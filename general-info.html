		<p>There is no direct public transportation to Red Butte Garden though there are options that will get you close to the Visitor Center and Amphitheatre. From these stops, you can either walk to the Garden or catch one of the University’s free shuttles. It is an uphill hike to the Garden and Amphitheatre from bus and TRAX stops, and there aren’t many sidewalks in Research Park, so you must walk on the road in some areas.</p>
		<p>Check the public transportation schedules for routes to the University of Utah campus, medical center, or Research Park before planning your trip to the Garden:</p>

		<h3 class="text-center green">Portrait Photography</h3>

		<p>Photographers and videographers who wish to conduct portrait photography at Red Butte Garden are required to purchase a portrait photography permit which is available at either a daily or yearly rate.</p>
		<p><b>Definition of portrait photography:</b> Red Butte Garden defines portrait photography as wedding, engagement, family portraits, or other posed portraiture of individuals by professional photographers/videographers or by amateurs acting in the role of a professional.</p>
		<p><b>Daily permits:</b> A portrait photography permit for non-exclusive use of the Garden may be purchased for $100 per day and covers the admission fee for the photographer and one assistant. Additional assistants and subjects/mobels will be charged regular admission fees.</p>
		<p><b>Yearly permits:</b> Photographers/videographers may purchase a yearly portrait photography permit for $500. Photography studios with more than one photographer will be charged an extra $25 per additional photographer, and each photographer will be provided with their own permit. The permit will be valid for the photographer listed on the card and one assistant. Other assistants and subjects/models will be charged regular admission fees. The permit is valid for a year from the date of purchase. All other rules and regulations apply.</p>
		<p><b>Wedding photography/portraits:</b> All photographers must call ahead to schedule wedding portrait sessions. We hold many wedding ceremonies and receptions at the Garden and will refuse requests for wedding photography during another's wedding. Any unscheduled wedding photography will be turned away if a wedding has also been scheduled for that day. Reservations are accepted up to 30 days in advance of the shoot.
		<br/><b>For reservations please contact the Event Coordinator at 801-585-9563 or the Assistant Event Coordinator at 801-587-5897.</b></p>
