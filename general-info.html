		<br />
		<p>There is no direct public transportation to Red Butte Garden though there are options that will get you close to the Visitor Center and Amphitheatre. From these stops, you can either walk to the Garden or catch one of the University’s free shuttles. It is an uphill hike to the Garden and Amphitheatre from bus and TRAX stops, and there aren’t many sidewalks in Research Park, so you must walk on the road in some areas.</p>
		<p>Check the public transportation schedules for routes to the University of Utah campus, medical center, or Research Park before planning your trip to the Garden:</p>
