			<p>We received notice from the John Prine family and Oh Boy Records that Mr. Prine had “an elevated risk for a stroke” and would undergo surgery to remedy the issue. Red Butte Garden and Mr. Prine’s team are working to reschedule the July 30 show. The current time period being considered is June of 2020.</p>

			<p>We will issue you a full refund now and place you on a priority list to purchase the same number of tickets for the re-scheduled date. We will send you an email with information about how to purchase tickets to the rescheduled show.</p>

			<p>A couple of notes about what happens next:</p>


			<p>If you purchased tickets online via Ticketfly: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Refunds for the ticket price and the $4.50 per-ticket fee will be issued to the original purchaser’s credit card that was used to purchase tickets. It will take 2-5 business days for the funds to be credited to your account.</li>
				<li>If your Ticketfly purchase included only this concert, your refund will also include the $5 transaction fee. If your transaction included additional concerts, the $5 transaction fee will not be included with your refund.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you purchased your tickets in person or over the phone from Red Butte Garden:</p>
			<ul>
					<li>If you paid with a credit card, you will see a credit back on the credit card that was used to make the purchase.</li>
					<li>If you paid by cash or check, you will receive a check for the refund amount by U.S. Mail to the address we have on file. Please review your account for accuracy.</li>
				</ul>


	<p>We are all disappointed that we will not be together Tuesday, July 30 as planned, and we send our best wishes for John’s full recovery and return to the stage.</p>
