<p class="bold text-center green">Open from 9AM-9PM - Free admission for children ages 17 and under thanks to a generous donation from Sandi Behnken</p>

<p class="text-center bold">Guided garden tours will be available throughout the day</p>

<p class="text-center">The Water Conservation Garden has been designed to demonstrate that beautiful gardens need not require heavy application of water. Our intent is to present a garden so attractive that home and business owners will want to garden and landscape in this way.</p>

<p class="text-center">This garden will bring an end to the myth that water-wise gardening can only exist in a landscape of rock and cacti. With the addition of this three-acre garden, Red Butte Garden will also add new educational programs to teach people how to create their own water-wise landscapes.</p>

<p class="text-center">Like all our gardens, the Water Conservation Garden will evolve and change over time as young plants mature and more water-wise plants become available in the trade.</p>
