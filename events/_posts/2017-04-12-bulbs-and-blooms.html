<h4 class="text-center green">SPRING BLING! 450,000 BLOOMING BULBS</h4>

<p class="text-center">One of the great botanical gardens in the West and a marvelous Daffodil display each spring is found at Red Butte Garden during the spring months of mid-March, April, and early May.</p>

<p class="text-center">Different bulb varieties peak at different times - so visit the Garden often this spring to see what's blooming.</p>

<p class="text-center">Every fall, Red Butte Garden volunteers and staff plant additional bulbs throughout the Garden and this spring the Garden will boast a colorful array of over 450,000 blooming bulbs! Of those over <a href="/red-butte-garden-daffodils">230,000 Daffodils</a>. Other bulbs include <em>Allium, Anemone, Calochortus, Camassia, Chionodoxa, Cyclamen, Erythronium, Fritillaria, Galanthus, Hyacinth, Hyacinthoides, Ipheion, Iris, Leucojum, Muscari, Scilla, Triteleia,</em> and more. Further complimenting the blooming bulbs are blossoming trees, shrubs, and vines such as Magnolia, Flowering Pear, Crabapple, Hawthorn, Viburnum, Wisteria, Foxtail Lily, Lilac, and more!</p>

<p class="text-center">Since 2013, Red Butte Garden has been recognized as an Official Display Garden by the American Daffodil Society. Our display includes 157 different cultivars from all 13 official divisions recognized by the Royal Horticultural Society of England. Our display also includes 14 recipients of the Wister and Panil Awards, which recognizes outstanding American hybridizers and daffodil selections.</p>

<p class="text-center">In mid-March, thousands of miniature bulbs including Reticulated Iris, Siberian Squill, and Glory-of-the-Snow are not to be missed in the Rose Garden. The miniature bulbs are soon followed by thousands of daffodils and other blooming bulbs throughout the Garden.</p>

<p class="text-center">Pack a picnic, bring your kids to play in the Childrenâ€™s Garden, take a walk through the Garden's paved paths, hike in the Natural Area, or just relax and take in the warm spring sun.</p>
