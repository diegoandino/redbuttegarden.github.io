<p class="text-center">Apples, cherries, apricots, pears, plums--how do you get the best from your fruit tree each year? Learn to care for your existing trees and give new ones a healthy start as we cover planting, pruning, thinning, pollination needs, recommended varieties, and common insects and diseases. Saturday's class will meet outside; please bring loppers and pruners to this class.  Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $76 + sp fee.</p>
