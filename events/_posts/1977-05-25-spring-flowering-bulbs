		<p>Plan and plant this fall for an early spring garden filled with color and diversity from a combination of spring blooming bulbs.  Daffodils and tulips take center stage as we look at recommended varieties and discuss selecting various cultivars so you have continuous color from early to late spring.  We’ll also discuss lesser known spring bloomers like Allium, Glory-of-the- Snow, Winter Aconite, Checkered Lily, and Snowdrops.  Design, planting, maintenance, and how to force some of these little gems for winter flowers indoors will be discussed.   Going dormant in summer, spring blooming bulbs are great landscape plants in Utah’s dry climate.   Get excited for spring this fall and have flowers next year as soon as the snow melts.
