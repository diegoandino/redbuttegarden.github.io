<p class="text-center">Hand-crafted botanical beauty products make fantastic gifts for family and friends. Lip balms, body scrubs, lotion bars and eye balms will be 'on the menu' of amazing items you'll create from natural, easy-to-find ingredients. Students will leave with up to 12 items, packaged and ready to give, plus the recipes and resources to continue production at home. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
