<p class="text-center">Follow the cascade of wildflower blooms across Northern Utah in this four-session class. We'll begin at Red Butte Garden with a little classroom time, then move into the foothills for a look at spring's first blooms. We'll continue to follow the wildflower bloom each class and will culminate our experience in the subalpine zone of Albion Basin in August. We'll spend the first part of each class learning about plant families and the plant communities located in the area we'll be visiting. Please bring a notebook to record your findings and a hand lens if you have one. The instructor will provide species lists for the wildflowers we are likely to see. Class requires some hiking. Co-sponsored by Lifelong Learning. Section 002 for Red Butte Garden members ($130+ $5)</p>
