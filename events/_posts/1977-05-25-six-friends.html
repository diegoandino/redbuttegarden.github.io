<p class="text-center">We Six Friends met as volunteers working for the Utah Artists 2002 show, a juried exhibit displayed alongside the 2002 Winter Olympics. Having since developed our own skills in various artistic mediums, we enjoy interpreting and celebrating the patterns, textures and joys of the natural world. We employ oils on canvas (and cigar boxes!), encaustic on paper, mixed media, and found objects for sculpture. </p>
