<blockquote class="tan-bg">

  <p class="text-center">"I am a collector of shapes and lines and colors. I like to explore the diversity of light in the world. People look at my work and want to put me in a “landscape” or “nature” box — well, okay, but I would say the outdoors is simply my studio or palette. I also do some cityscapes and antiquity sort of things, and what attracts me again is the shapes and colors. It was probably the first time I looked through a viewfinder — I discovered I could break up a complex and bewildering world into approachable chunks of beauty and simplicity."</p>
