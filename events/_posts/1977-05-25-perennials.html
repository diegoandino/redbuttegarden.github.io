<p class="text-center">Walk the aisles of any garden center in spring, and you'll find yourself in the midst of a cornucopia of scent and color. The sign says "perennials," and you know which ones appeal to you, but what else do you know about them? Whether you are starting a new garden or refreshing an existing one, you'll want to select plants suited to your individual landscape and to pick combinations that offer color and blooms from early spring until frost. Through slides, discussion, and garden walks, we will show you the characteristics of a diverse group of perennials suited to Utah gardens that bloom in spring and summer. For perennials that bloom late summer and fall, please take Perennials: Late Summer and Fall Bloomer. We'll also cover design, soil preparation, planting, and maintenance.</p>
