<p class="text-center">Did you know April is National Poetry Month? Celebrate this unique literary art with a stroll through the Garden to find eleven poetry boxes featuring poems written by winners of our Spring Poetry Contest.</p>

<p class="text-center">Throughout the month, you can also interact with our winning poets via your cell phone on a special audio tour featuring recordings of our contest winners performing readings of their poems. The audio tour is free, but normal cell phone carrier usage rates apply.</p>

<p class="text-center">To access the audio tour, please follow the instructions posted at each poetry box. While enjoying the tour, please be considerate of other Garden guests and listen to audio content through headphones or your phoneâ€™s earpiece.</p>

<!--<p>Sign up to attend a Garden Poetry Reading featuring live readings from many of the poets themselves on Wednesday, April 26 from 5:30-6:30PM. <a href="/poetry-reading">CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP</a></p>
