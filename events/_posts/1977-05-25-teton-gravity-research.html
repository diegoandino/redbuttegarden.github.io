<p class="text-center">Salt Lake City, get ready! On Wednesday, September 19, <strong>Teton Gravity Research</strong> is returning to Red Butte Garden for the winter kick-off party of the year. Join us for a one-night only premiere of our new feature length ski and snowboard film, FAR OUT, presented by REI.

<br />

<p class="text-center"><b>Come prepared for the weather!</b> Even the warmest days in September can get pretty chilly when the sun goes down in the Amphitheatre at the mouth of Red Butte Canyon. Film is rain or shine (pending lightning, high winds, or torrential downpour).

<br / >

<p class="text-center">As always, this event is BYOB - grab your low-back chairs, blankets, and coolers and come out for a great time in an incredible setting.

<br / >

<p class="text-center">Come early for live music featuring SLC local band (to be announced soon), There will be athlete appearances and a ton of prizes from our partners at REI, Yeti, Atomic, Volkl, Outdoor Research, and others!

<p class="text-center"><b>About the film:</b> Far Out embodies the imagination as much as it does a physical space. It is the quest to seek out undiscovered realms and inspire new waves of creativity, enlightenment, and progression. It is the quest to be blown away.
