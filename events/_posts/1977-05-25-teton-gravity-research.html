<p class="text-center"><b>Gates open at 6PM with live music (TBA), movie starts around 8PM.</b>

<br />

<p class="text-center">Salt Lake City, get ready! On Tuesday, September 19, Teton Gravity Research is returning to Red Butte Garden for the winter kick-off party of the year. Join TGR for a one-night only premiere of their new feature length ski and snowboard film, Rogue Elements, presented by REI.

<br />

<p class="text-center"><b>Come prepared for the weather!</b> Even the warmest days in September can get pretty chilly when the sun goes down in the Amphitheatre at the base of Red Butte Canyon. Film is rain or shine (pending lightning, high winds, or torrential downpour).

<br / >

<p class="text-center">As always, this event is BYOB - grab your low-back chairs, blankets, and coolers and come out for a great time in an incredible setting. There will be athlete signings, plus a ton of prizes from TGR partners REI, ATOMIC SKIING, VÃ–LKL, CEP Compression USA, TGR and more.
Plus, everyone in attendance will have a shot at the TGR tour grand prizes - a trip for two to our hometown Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, a trip to your very own Ski City (including a VIP tour of the High West distillery), a trip to Crested Butte, Colorado, Atomic Skis, or REI gift cards.

<br />

<p class="text-center"><b>About the film:</b> In the winter of 2017, the magnitude of winter's force was on full display. Telephone pole-snapping storms pounded the Wyoming landscape. Regions to the west, recently left arid and forgotten, were gifted with unprecedented accumulation. Blizzards in Europe buried towns in an instant before disappearing just as fast, leaving the lucky few who were there to wonder if it even happened. A Bolivian expedition found grace above 18,000 feet before the elements went rogue and the humans reluctantly heeded warnings from above.

<br />

<p class="text-center">Join the TGR team as they embark on an adventure filled with fury and glory, and witness the unimaginable. Rogue Elements, presented by REI, features Angel Collinson, Jeremy Jones, Ian McIntosh, Elyse Saugstad, Tim Durtschi, Dash Longe, Nick McNutt, Hadley Hammer, Johnny Collinson, Thayne Rich, Sammy Carlson, Dane Tudor, Clayton Villa, Cam Riley, Sean Jordan, Griffin Post, Sam Smoothy, and Sammy Luebke.</p>
