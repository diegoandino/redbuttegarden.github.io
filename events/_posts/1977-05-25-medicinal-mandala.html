<p class="text-center">The word Mandala literally means circle and has its origin in the Sanskrit language. It is often linked with our planet and environment. In this class, artists will be supplied with a portfolio containing medicinal plant line drawings and color photos with their history and usage by indigenous tribes. The artist will select and cut out the plant parts of their choosing and will repeat them around a provided circular template and will transfer them to drawing paper for rendering in colored pencils. Demos provided.</p>
