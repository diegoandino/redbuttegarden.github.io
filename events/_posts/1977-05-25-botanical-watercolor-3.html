<p class="text-center">Watercolor-3 will introduce and revisit three watercolor techniques over a six-week class period, six hours per technique. We will work on hot or soft press watercolor paper (8x10”) and we will work from floral photos in watercolor combined with graphite, color pencil and pen and ink. This class will help prepare artists for the Rare &amp; Endangered Plant classes in 2018 in preparation for an exhibition of such plants at the Red Butte Garden gallery, date not scheduled.</p>
<u>The three mini classes will include:</u></br>
