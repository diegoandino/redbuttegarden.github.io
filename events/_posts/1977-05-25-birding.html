<p class="text-center">Enjoy the Garden’s cool morning breezes and join us for a morning walk full of wildlife activity. Bullock’s Oriole, Western Tanager, Downy Woodpecker, and American Gold Finch are just some of the many birds we’re likely to see. Bring your binoculars and drop in for one or more of the scheduled birding walks. Tours are intended for adults. In case of inclement weather, please call: 801-585-0556 to check event status.</p>

      <p class="text-center"><a href="/documents/rbg-birding-brochure.pdf">RED BUTTE GARDEN BIRDING BROCHURE</a></p>

      <p class="text-center">Abundant water in ponds and Red Butte Creek, ample food sources, adequate cover, and protection within the 100 acre Garden attract birds not typically found in the surrounding foothills and neighborhoods.</p>

      <p class="text-center bold">Want To See More Birds?</p>

      <p class="text-center">Wear muted clothing. Avoid wearing stark white- it can startle away many birds. Speak softly, walk slowly, make no sudden gestures. Stop often or find a shady place to sit and watch.</p>
