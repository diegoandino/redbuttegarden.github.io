<p class="text-center">Gardens grow, and that can be both a blessing and a curse. The fresh young blooms of spring fade, stalks bend and droop, groundcover runs amok, and spent flowers turn brown on their stems. What's a gardener to do? With a little maintenance know-how, you can extend the bloom of some favorite perennials, get a second bloom from others, control invasive plantings, prop or strengthen weak stems, and overall neaten your summer and fall garden. Join us as we get hands-on experience deadheading, pruning, thinning, dividing, and transplanting--and keep your garden looking grand all season long. Co-sponsored by Lifelong Learning.</p>
