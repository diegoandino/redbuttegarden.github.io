<p class="text-center">Red Butte Garden is the Utah State Arboretum, and contains an amazing collection of beautiful trees, many of which are stunning in Winter. In this class, students will begin by creating a sketching reference by photographing selected trees. They will then create their tree portraits to include in a tree album, containing descriptions, history, and drawings of details (ie: bark, leaves, flowers, pods and seeds). Artists will work in the medium of their choice. The instructor will work in graphite with watercolor and colored pencil. Class will be offered quarterly, to highlight the seasonal changes of their trees.   Class includes a special introductory session on Saturday, February 23, from 1-4PM. </p>
