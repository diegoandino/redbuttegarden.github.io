<p class="text-center"><h4 class="text-center">CONNECTING HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT</h4></p>

<p class="text-center">Inspired by nature and built from more than 450,000 LEGO pieces, this exhibition will feature 14 displays with sculptures that represent the incredible connections that sustain life on earth.</p>

<p class="text-center">As every child knows, LEGO bricks connect together to grow intricate, creative, and colorful constructions. Just as LEGO bricks connect, so too is everything in nature interconnected to create a complex and amazing network with each piece relying on the others to grow and thrive.</p>

<p class="text-center">Through this exhibition, Garden guests may learn how they are personally connected to plants, how plants rely on diversity, how plants rely on pollinators, and how humans rely on the wonders of the natural world.</p>
