<p class="text-center">Warning! Keeping a nature sketchbook/journal may lead to uncontrollable urges to spend more time out of doors and explore new beautiful surroundings beyond your home, neighborhood or state. Join us for two evening classes and one day class in the Garden. Step-by-step instruction will guide you from first stroke to a finished sketch. Learn new techniques that will enhance your sketchbook skills using graphite and watercolor pencils.</p>

<p class="text-center">Sketchbook and field kit (graphite, watercolor pencils and tools) will be provided. Please bring a roll of Scotch brand Removable Tape available at office supply stores, and a small notebook (optional). All skill levels welcome and beginners are encouraged to attend.</p>
