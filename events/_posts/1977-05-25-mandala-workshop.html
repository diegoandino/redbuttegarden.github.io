<p class="text-center">Create a beautiful and memorable keepsake Mandala of Christmas flower imagery stencils including Poinsettias, winter roses, holly, Ivy, Mistletoe ornaments and - new this year - a collection of Celtic designs. You may select from provided line drawing templates or design your own and arrange them on a circular template around a blank center circle, which will carry your personal message. A professional calligrapher will be at the class to ink your message with an elegant flair. When complete, frame it in a silver frame and gift it or keep it.</p>
