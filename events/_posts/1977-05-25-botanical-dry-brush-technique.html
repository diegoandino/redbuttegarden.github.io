<p class="text-center">One of the techniques most often missing in a beginner's watercolor painting is the dry brush technique. The dry brush technique can add a great deal of energy, detail and interest to any painting in any fluid medium. Paint is taken up with a small "detail" brush with very little moisture. Paint is applied with small hatching-like strokes applied in layers in a slow color weaving process. The process is slow going but the results are truly beautiful. WC dry brush works well with wet into wet underpainting and is great technique and will add beautiful detail to your paintings.  </p>
