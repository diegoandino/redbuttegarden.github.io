<p class="text-center">Since the time of Julius Caesar and the reign of Queen Victoria, flowers have been used to enhance culinary creations and cocktails.  Learn about edible flowers and which ones have the most culinary interest, how to harvest, when and how to use them, and what they taste like.  Discover some unusual or lesser known fleurs and go home with an arsenal of recipes and knowledge to wrap up your gardening season with ideas to continue using edible flowers throughout the holiday season.  Class includes both indoor and outdoor components including edible flower tasting and walking amongst the flowers of Red Butte Garden when we will identify plants and get tips for growing your own edible flowers.
