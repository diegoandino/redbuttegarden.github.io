<p>Did you know April is National Poetry Month? Celebrate this important literary art with a stroll through the Garden. Throughout April the Garden will host a special audio tour featuring recordings of our spring poetry contest winners performing readings of their poems, all accessible from your cell phone.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions at each poetry box to access audio recordings. The audio tour is free, but normal cell phone carrier usage rates apply. Please be considerate of other Garden guests and listen to audio content through headphones or your phoneâ€™s earpiece.</p>

<p>Sign up to attend a Garden Poetry Reading featuring live readings from many of the poets themselves on Tuesday, April 26 from 6-7PM. <a href="/poetry-reading">CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP</a></p>
