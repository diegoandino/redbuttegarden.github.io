<p class="text-center">Evergreen and deciduous trees and shrubs are the backbone of the landscape and making the right selections for your garden is key to being successful and creating the look you are hoping to achieve. We will focus on 60 trees and shrubs suited for the Utah landscape discussing plant characteristics, size, growth pattern, and maintenance requirements so you can make appropriate choices for your garden. Class includes Garden walks that will inspire and educate you about the trees, shrubs best suited to Utah's environment. We'll also cover where to purchase and best times to plant. Most of class time is spent walking to view the trees and shrubs in the Garden, so dress appropriately for weather and for walking. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $107 + sp fee, register for section 002.</p>
