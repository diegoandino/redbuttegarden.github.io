<p class="text-center">Do you lack sufficient sun or garden space for a vegetable or herb garden? Don't let that stop you from growing succulent, flavorful, nutritious fresh herbs and veggies. Many herbs and vegetables thrive in containers, which you can position or move to take advantage of sunny spots. You'll learn which vegetables and herbs do well in containers as well as tricks to keep them producing throughout summer and into fall. You will have the opportunity to plant the vegetables of your choice into a 15-inch container for take-home enjoyment.
