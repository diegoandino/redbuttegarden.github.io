<p class="tetx-center">This is a foundation class that introduces artists to the basics of botanical drawing with graphite pencils and the technical properties of drawing materials e.g. papers, erasers etc. Students will learn the vocabulary of drawing and will develop good observation skills. In addition, artists will complete a series of exercises and will draw using a photo and/or a live plant.</p>
