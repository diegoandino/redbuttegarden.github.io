<p class="text-center">Spend time at the Garden creating a striking fall container planting. After reviewing plants suitable for fall container gardening, including cool-season annuals, perennials, shrubs, and trees, we will each create a container masterpiece that will hold up through Thanksgiving, and potentially through winter. You'll receive a 16-inch LINER that will fit in your own decorative container, soil, plants, and design suggestions. Please meet at the Garden greenhouse. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $35 + sp fee, register for section 002 or 004.
