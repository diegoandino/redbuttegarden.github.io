    <p class="text-center">Botanical Art & Illustration courses such as Pen & Ink, watercolor, Nature Sketching & Journaling, Drawing and Scientific Botanical Illustration are more popular than ever. We are fortunate to have Elaine Hultgren, a certified Botanical Art and Illustration instructor, teaching beginner and intermediate classes in several mediums. Student artists enjoy comprehensive courses that are skill-building in an encouraging environment. Each course develops observation skills, creating 3-dimensional form, principles of composition, color theory, and basic perspective.</p>
