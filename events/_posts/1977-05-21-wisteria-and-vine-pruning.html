<p class="text-center">Wisteria offers breathtaking beauty and fragrance to the spring garden. However, the fact that they benefit from careful pruning and training to be at their best has compelled some to suggest Wisteria is Latin for work.  Dispel the myth by joining us for this hands-on workshop as we demonstrate how our gardeners create and maintain our spectacular Wisteria collection.  We will also briefly cover pruning of other common vines but not roses.  For climbing rose pruning, please take Rose Pruning Workshop.  Wear appropriate clothing and bring gloves and hand pruners. Limited to 12 participants. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $40, register for section 002. </p>
