<p class="text-center">Gardening in containers can transform your balcony, deck, or patio into more than just barbeque space. Learn how to create a soothing outdoor retreat by adding containers filled with flowering plants. Weâ€™ll look at container design and selection, how to combine plants for aesthetic arrangements, plant selection, and maintenance. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
