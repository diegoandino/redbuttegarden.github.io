<p class="text-center">Moku hanga is a Japanese method of woodblock printmaking. It is water based, and brushes are used to apply pigment to the woodblock. A starch paste, traditionally made from rice, is also used to manipulate the pigment texture. The technique allows for subtle transparent layers of color, each of which adds a different dimension to the image.</p>
