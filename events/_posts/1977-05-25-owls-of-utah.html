  <p class="text-center">Owls have some of the most unforgettable faces in the avian kingdom with their huge eyes and abundant feathers. They demand our attention in so many ways. In this class, we will explore and create at least 2-4 of the 13 species who reside in Utah as well as learn much about them that escape the grasp of common knowledge.</p>
