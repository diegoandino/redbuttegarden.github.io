<p class="text-center">Join the Utah Orchid Society for a dazzling display of both common and exotic orchid varieties. Society members will share methods for keeping plants healthy and happy, and provide troubleshooting advice for budding orchid enthusiasts. A large selection of both plants and pottery will be on sale for those interested in starting their own collection.</p>

<p>This is the largest Orchid Show display in Utah.</p>
