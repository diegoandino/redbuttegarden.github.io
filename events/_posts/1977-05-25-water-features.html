<p class="text-center">Soothing sound, cooling effect, and providing habitat for wildlife are all reasons to consider adding water to your garden. A water garden can be as simple as a waterproof container with a small pump or as elaborate as a pond with a waterfall or stream. We'll cover types of water gardens, pumps, location, basic installation, and maintenance as well as give you guidelines for water garden costs. First class meets at Red Butte Garden and is primarily lecture. Saturday is field day and meets at instructor's garden. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.  Special fee includes cost of pond tour ticket which is Aug 10 and 11.</p>
