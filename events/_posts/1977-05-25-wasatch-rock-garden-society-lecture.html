<p class="text-center">The Wasatch Rock Garden Society and the North American Rock Garden Society are pleased to partner with Red Butte Garden in presenting an exceptional international speaker, Zdenek Zvolanek from Karlik, a village about 20 miles from Prague, in the Czech Republic.  Zdenek, fondly known as “ZZ,”  is famous among rock gardeners for his “Beauty Slope” crevice garden that is filled with botanical treasures from around the world, including Utah.  Join us for an entertaining and educational evening with this rock star of the gardening world.</p>
