<p class="text-center">The Wasatch Rock Garden Society and the North American Rock Garden Society are once again pleased to partner with Red Butte Garden in presenting an exceptional international speaker, Kit Strange, Alpine Horticulturist from Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in London, England.
According to an interview in the British periodical Horticulture Week (2009), Kit started at Kew after earning her RHS diploma at Wisley. She is an alpine bulb specialist and spends much of her time potting and maintaining bulbs as well as growing alpine plants. In addition to that, she travels in the field in search of new botanical treasures to grow in the gardens at Kew.</p>

<p class="text-center">Her presentation on “Travels in Armenia” will give us insight on what that kind of field work involves and what discoveries she made along the way. Armenia has a climate quite similar to Utah with hot and dry summers and cold and snowy winters. It is located in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia, bordered by Georgia to the north, Turkey to the west, Azerbaijan to the east and Iran to the south. The plant material discovered there should translate well to gardens in Utah.
This is a lecture not to be missed!  Mark your calendars and join us for a wonderful plant adventure in Armenia. Light refreshments prior to lecture.
