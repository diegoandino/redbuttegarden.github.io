<p class="text-center">Japanese maples are elegant trees and when properly pruned can be transformed into living sculpture and garden art. Don't let the fragile branching structure of your Japanese maples intimidate you anymore. This hands-on class will focus on the finer points of pruning and give you the confidence to successfully prune your Japanese maples. Focus is on Japanese maples but techniques can be applied to other specimen trees. One classroom session followed by two hands-on field days will give you the knowledge, practice, and confidence to prune your own trees. Wear appropriate clothing and bring gloves and hand pruners to Saturday classes. Prerequisite Pruning 101 or other pruning basics class. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning.</p>
