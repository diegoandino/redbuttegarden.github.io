<p class="text-center">You've seen pictures of spectacular gardens in your favorite magazines, but now you can see them first hand. Treat your senses to an array of sights, smells, and sounds while visiting garden treasures in the Salt Lake area. We'll leisurely wonder through two gardens each evening discussing garden design, plant selection, water features, outdoor living spaces, container plants, and more. Take home some great ideas for your own garden and learn what makes a yard a garden. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. You will be notified where to meet before the first class.</p>
