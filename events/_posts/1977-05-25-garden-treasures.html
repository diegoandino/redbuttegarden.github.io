<p class="text-center">Most of us are familiar with ladybugs, praying mantis and lacewings, but did you know that there are a whole host of good bugs that can help us naturally control aphids, spider mites, and all kinds of troublesome garden pests. In this class on attracting natureâ€™s pest control, we will discuss many of the common predators and parasitic insects and the diversity of organisms that are beneficial to people by controlling problem pests in our landscapes. We will also discuss the diversity of plants that can be grown to attract and nourish these natural pest controls. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. You will be notified where to meet before the first class. Members pay $53 + sp fee, register for section 002.</p>
