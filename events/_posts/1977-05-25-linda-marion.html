<h4 class="text-center green">Artist Statement</h4>
<p class="text-center"><em>I have been working as a visual artist for many years and focus primarily on landscapes, still life, and what I call "nature paintings," or elements in a landscape. Close-ups of trees, plants and flowers are of particular interest to me, especially as sunlight illuminates the structural details and enhances the variations in hue and color, ranging from cool to warm and radiant, and dark to light. </em></p>

<p class="text-center">The colorations and variations in form are subtle, requiring extensive blending and shading. Many of the paintings in this exhibit were inspired by plants and flowers in my own backyard, the local parks where I walk my dog, the red-rock landscapes of Southern Utah, or trees in nearby alpine forests.</p>
