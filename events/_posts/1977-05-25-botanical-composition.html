<p class="text-center">Imaginative, interesting and dynamic composition can transform a botanical painting or illustration into a masterpiece. It is through composition that you introduce your own personal style into your work. This class helps to explain the elements that go towards creating a good composition and the basic principles underlying a successful illustration. The class will work entirely in graphite pencil, but the principles presented apply to all art media.</p>
