<p class="text-center">This is a foundation class that will introduce students to nibs and holders as well as drafting and fiber tipped pens. A variety of inks will be available such as black, walnut, and colored inks. Students will complete creative pen stroke exercises.</p>

<br />

<h4 class="green">MATERIALS LIST:</h4>
<p class="bold">Ink, Dinky Dips (for ink), Pen nibs and holders will be provided for each artist.</p>

<ol>
  <li>A pad of tracing paper (Canson Calco red, white and black cover) only available locally at Hobby Lobby – 40% off coupon.</li>
  <li>A roll of Scotch brand removable tape Purple plaid card.</li>
  <li>A 12” ruler</li>
  <li>A Puling Pen, Google “ruling pen” to see photos. They can be found at office supply stores that still carry drafting tools- such as Staples or OfficeMax. Do not pay more than $6-$7 for it. Professional models are priced too high at $18, an inexpensive brush to fill with ink. Ruling Pens used with a ruler make clean straight lines.</li>
  <li>Three to four fiber-tipped Drawing Pens. Recommended brands can be purchased at Blick/Utrecht in Sugarhouse.</li>
  Staedler Pigment Liner: best, archival, waterproof, lightfast and longer lasting. The best buy is a set of four pens in case, fine line to medium thick. Price: $13.15 locally. You can also buy individual pens for $3.59 to add to your collection.
  <li>Three to four Micron Pigma Archival Pens, waterproof, fade-proof also available at Blick Utrecht, but is not as long lasting but are my second choice because they too are available locally, sets available. Buy 005, .01, .02 and .05.
  <br />
  <strong>OR</strong> A set of three point sizes: Black — One each of 01 (0.25 mm), 03 (0.35 mm), and 05 (0.45 mm). Black ink. ADD the 005 which is not included in set price of $6.59. Individual pens cost: $2.59</li>
  <li>Pencils: 2H, 4H, and a Pentel Clic Eraser (a white plastic retractable eraser sold at Staples &amp; OfficeMax) and a kneaded gray eraser (wildly available).</li>
  <li>11"x14" Bristol 300 Series “Smooth” paper pad. You might already have this paper. If not: Strathmore 300 Series</li>
  <li>Bristol pad. Smooth finish. This is an excellent paper for exercises.</li>
