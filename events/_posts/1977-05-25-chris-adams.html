<!--<p class="text-center">Artist Statement: I enjoy creating art by doing something totally different. Most of my pieces depict the place I grew up in and love, Cache Valley and Utah. I feel it is important for me to depict the illustration of the familiar, very beautiful and sometimes odd places in Cache Valley and Utah that individuals here are reflective about.</p>
