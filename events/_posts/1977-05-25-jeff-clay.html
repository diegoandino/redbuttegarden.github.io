  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artists Reception<br />
  Saturday, May 13 from 2-4PM</p>

</div>-->

<p class="text-center">Artist Statement: Reflecting different personal interests, my photographic techniques and subjects are also diverse. Gothic cathedrals, still life, dusty mediaeval villages, modern architecture, abstract patterns of light and shadow, remote desert valleys, the people and places of Asia - these and more are all parts of the varied canvas I photograph. I also utilize different photographic techniques and tools including infrared photography, black and white conversion, bracketed exposure blending, and the panorama format.</p>
