<p class="text-center">The Park City Professional Artists’ Association (PCPAA) is an alliance for the promotion of art within the Park City community. Started in 1981 by six artists who had businesses or studios in Park City, the organization has since evolved into a group of over sixty working artists. Members are committed not only to their individual work, but also have a strong commitment to supporting and advancing the arts.</p>
