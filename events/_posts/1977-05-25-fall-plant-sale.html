<p class="text-center red bold">Thank you for making the 2017 Fall Bulb &amp Native Plant Sale a success.</p>

<!--<p class="text-center red bold">Please enter through the Red Butte Garden Visitor Center</p>-->

<p class="text-center">Support the Garden at our Annual Fall Bulb and Native Plant Sale Fundraiser. You will find spring flowering bulbs, garlic bulbs, native and water-wise plants, ornamental grasses, flowering perennials and more!</p>

<p class="text-center">Fall is a great time to plant, and the best time to plant spring flowering bulbs, as well as garlic. We will have several selections of garlic bulbs for sale, and a variety of flowering bulbs including: Daffodils, Tulips, Hyacinth, Flowering Onion, early blooming miniature bulbs, and even some fall blooming bulbs.</p>

<p class="text-center">Although not quite as extensive as the Spring Plant Sale, we believe our Fall Sale has the best selection of water-wise and native plants! If you haven’t come to our Fall Plant Sale yet, it’s about time you did.</p>

<p class="text-center">There are so many species and cultivars of ornamental grasses, offering a variety of different sizes, heights, colors, and textures. Allow yourself some time to enjoy the Garden before shopping and see how these fabulous grasses may work in your yard.</p>

<p class="text-center">There will also be a wide selection of flowering perennials, including selections for both sunny and shady locations, and a variety of own-root roses! Take your time to browse through treasured and to hard-to-find gems.</p>

<p class="text-center red bold">All Plant Sale Purchases are final.</p>

<p class="text-center green bold">Thank You For Your Support of the Garden!</p>

      <ul>

        <li>Our extensive vegetable selection this year includes over 180 different varieties. This includes 60 different tomato cultivars, 32 different peppers (sweet and hot), 21 pumpkins and squash and a wide range of greens. At least 95 different vegetables are heirlooms. We will offer both an heirloom and a hybrid selection for most of the vegetables available. Quite a few of the selections will have been trialed here at the Garden, so you can try the varieties our staff and volunteers have grown and recommended. We will also have a selection of smaller cultivars that are ideal for small spaces or container gardening.</li><br />

        <li>Nothing beats the color of flowering annuals for the summer garden! We will have a variety of colors and textures, sun and shade annuals, as well as a wide variety of succulents. And, don’t forget a hanging basket or mixed planter as a great Mother’s Day gift!</li><br />

        <li>Don’t forget your favorite culinary, medicinal, tea, and fragrance herbs! Great fresh or preserved, we have a wide variety to grow and enjoy at home. Check out the slow-to-bolt Cilantro ‘Ole’ or the Rosemary ‘Gorizia’. Get them and your favorite Lavender varieties before they’re gone! This year we’ll have several new varieties of Basil; like ‘Balsamic Blooms’ with gorgeous ornamental, edible flowers! Try combinations like Chamomile, Lemon Grass and Mint in a container to stock up your tea cabinet. Save money on your grocery bill and have fun!!</li><br />

        <li>We will have over 300 different species and cultivars of perennials, including sun loving, and shade loving. There is definitely something for every type of situation, including high elevation gardens and bee-friendly plants. Check out the ‘Specialty Perennial’ section if you’re looking for something truly unique, and allow yourself plenty of time to browse!</li><br />

        <li>Ornamental grasses add texture and movement to your garden! Often overlooked, grasses serve many functions in a garden in addition to aesthetics. Ornamental Grasses can be used as a focal point or in mass, and come in a variety of colors, textures, sizes, bloom times, and water requirements. Come choose from Bluestem, Feather Reed, Sea Oats, Silver Grass, Muhly, Moor grass and more, including selections ideal for shadier areas, such as Japanese Forest Grass and Sedges. No matter the site conditions or your personal taste we are sure to have an ornamental grass for you!</li><br />

        <li>Groundcovers can solve many garden problems, such as steep slopes and masking tough areas with texture and color. From vigorous foliage cover like Wintercreeper and Pachysandra, to delicate flowering swathes of Blue Lithodora or Delosperma, we have a groundcover for every growing condition. Don’t forget about the eye-catching Plumbago for three-season interest!</li><br />

        <li>Our selection of roses includes old-fashioned garden roses, modern shrub roses, miniatures and climbers. Beautiful blooms of all colors, combined with winter hardiness and disease-resistance, make lovely additions in the home landscape. All our roses are ‘own-root’, not grafted, which means although they may be small at first, your favorite rose will not revert back to a root stock variety after a harsh winter.</li><br />

        <li>We offer a wide variety of flowering and shade trees, unique conifers, colorful shrubs and flowering vines. We also offer a variety of fruit trees, berry bushes, strawberries and rhubarb. Come with your questions and site information and let us help you select the right plant for your situation.</li><br />
