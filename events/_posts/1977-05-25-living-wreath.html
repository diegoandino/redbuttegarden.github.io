We'll provide a 13-inch wreath frame, moss and succulent plants, as well as cover care and maintenance of your living wreath. You're sure to become the envy of the neighborhood with this statement of true living beauty. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning; members pay $35 + special fee (ask for section 002).</p>
