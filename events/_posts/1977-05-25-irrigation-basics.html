<p class="text-center">Whether your landscaping involves waterwise plantings, plants that require regular water, or a combination of the two, using the right irrigation for your landscape can substantially reduce water use while helping your garden flourish. Join us as we explore smart irrigation practices that give plants the water they need to thrive (no more, no less) and deliver that water in the most efficient way possible. We'll cover maintenance of existing irrigation systems, converting to drip and spray heads where appropriate, and other key topics to enhance your home irrigation system.
