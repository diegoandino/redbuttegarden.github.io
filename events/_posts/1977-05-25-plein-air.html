<p class="text-center">Enjoy the warm summer evenings as you create small-scale landscapes in lovely Red Butte Garden. Students will view demonstrations and receive exercises in washes, blending, wet on wet, lifting, brushstrokes, glazing, and drybrush. Instruction in composition, positive and negative space, value studies, and color theory will round out the offering. Painting topics will include landscapes, still life, and water reflections. You are responsible for your materials; you can find a list online, or call 801-587-5433. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. (LLART 170)</p>
