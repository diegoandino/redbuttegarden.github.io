Instruction in composition, positive and negative space, value studies, and color theory will round out the offering. Painting topics will include landscapes, still life, and water reflections. You are responsible for your materials; you can find a list online, or call 801-587-5433. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning. Members pay $197, ask for section 002. This class is limited to 10.</p>
