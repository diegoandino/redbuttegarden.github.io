<p class="text-center">This class has the purpose of defining with scientific accuracy a plant and its parts using a voucher (Plant and parts are dried and mounted on special board) we will work with both a botanist and a scientific illustrator. A good botanical illustration can do without commentary and has the advantage of being understood by anyone in any language. It is an art form by virtue of its sensitivity to line, composition and botanical detail.</p>
