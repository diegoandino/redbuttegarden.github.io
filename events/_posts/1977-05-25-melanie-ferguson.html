<p class="text-center">The need to discover has always driven people to traverse the world in search of something new. Mixed media abstract painter Melanie Ferguson has experienced this drive throughout her life, but she has found in her many travels that discovery can happen anywhere, across the world or in her own home. Her unique, textured paintings, transports viewers into these everyday journeys.Ferguson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, and lived in that area for most of her childhood, and adolescence. Her grandfather owned a small cabin in American Fork Canyon, and Ferguson has fond memories of spending time there during her childhood. “I truly believe that is where I fell in love with nature and being outdoors,” she says. Melanie’s life was grounded in nature and the simple pleasures of her childhood imagination. </p>
