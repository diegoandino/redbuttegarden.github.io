  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artist Reception<br />
  Saturday, August 18 from 1-4PM</p>

<p class="text-center">My love of nature inspires me to paint the artwork I create. I started as a Plein Air painter, which really expanded my color palette. I loved the natural, free forms in nature, which created an interest in impressional/ abstract work. Im intrigued how color, natural elements, and textures merge, and can create those happy accidents in my abstract work. I want my viewers to physically experience the textures I create. </p>
