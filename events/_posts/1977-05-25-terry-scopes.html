  <p class="text-center bold">Meet the Artists Reception<br />
  Saturday, August 3 from 2-4PM</p>

</div>

<p class="text-center">I am an abstract expressionist artist. My use of vibrant colors and bold layered marks are a unique pairing of realism and fantasy.

 All of my paintings are acrylic/mixed media works on canvas or wood studio panels.

 In addition to paint, I use graphite, chalk pastels, oil pastels, ink, ephemera, and charcoal to add variety and contrast to my mark making.

 My painting tools include brushes, trowels, power sanders, scrapers, nails, hammer, my fingers, and towels…anything I can find to create a surface finish that adds a sense of story, history, and mystery to the work.

 I want viewers’ first take of my paintings to be one of the big picture. On the second take I want them to become curious by the subtle marks and patinas, which, to me is a sweet reward for them looking closer and exploring. It is an invitation to feel as well as see.</p>

<p class="text-center">Ms. Scopes studied art at the University of Utah, as well as with extraordinary painters that includes Nicholas Wilton, Lynn Whipple and Flora Bowley. She currently lives and works out of her home studio in Salt Lake City, Utah. Her work has been exhibited throughout the West and can be found in private collections in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.</p>
