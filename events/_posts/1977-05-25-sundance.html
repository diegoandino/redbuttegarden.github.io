			<h4 class="text-center">CON AIR 2</h4>

			<p>Former Army Ranger Cameron Poe (Nicholas Cage) has redeemed himself with his heroism in the events of first Con Air. After re-examination of his case, Poe received a personal pardon for his felony from the President of the United States. With his record and reputation clean, Poe received national attention and quickly became a security advisor for the United States Military. His daughter has grown up, and his wife tragically passed away a few months after his release. To numb the pain of her loss after so much time in prison, Poe immersed himself in alcohol and serving his country once more. His inner pain has affected his relationship with his daughter, and it will take a special woman to make him feel and love again.</p>

			<p>Having earned a top-level military security clearance almost two decades after his last adventure, Poe has been called upon to be the physical security consultant of a top-secret prison on the moon, designed exclusively for the most deadly criminals on the planet. Poe's loyalty is tested when he meets an old Army friend in the prison who informs that the moon base is actually a CONspiracy involving highly influential members of the global elite.</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">FACES OFF <em>(FACE OFF 2)</em></h4>

			<p>A rogue terrorist cell with ties to Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) has come out of hiding and is seeking revenge - destroying US Military and government installations across the country. Various attempts to infiltrate the group have proved unsuccessful, and many good agents have died in the process. A line is finally crossed when an attack goes awry, killing and wounding hundreds of civilians including Dr. Eve Archer (Joan Allen), who is seriously wounded and put into a coma.</p>

			<p>Now only a few years from retirement and with his wife incapacitated, Archer must once again become the ruthless nemesis he defeated so many years ago - Castor Troy. Can Archer quell the demons of his past without bloodshed, or will his own face become a mask in the struggle to fight fire with fire?</p>

			<p>After hallucinating an inebriated stupor where he drinks himself to death, Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) wakes up two weeks before Christmas in a Las Vegas hotel room in a bath of ice missing a kidney. Despite discovering that all of his money, credit cards, and forms of identification have been stolen, Sanderson realizes that his life wasn't so bad after all and vows to get back to Hollywood and write again.</p>

			<p>To fund his trip home, Ben gets a job at a mall on the Vegas strip working as Santa Claus, and with the help of a few street magicians and working girls discovers the true meaning of Christmas.</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">VAMPIRE'S KISS 2</h4>

			<p>After gradually going insane and believing himself to be a Vampire, things did not end well for Peter Loew (Nicolas Cage). Though mortally impaled through the chest, the stake intended to end him somehow misses his heart, and moments before death an actual vampire bat flies through the bedroom window and bites Loew - restoring his health and giving him the powers (and teeth) he already thought he had!</p>

			<p>With his vigor and sanity restored, Loew reverts to his millionaire playboys ways. This time, however, he seduces the women of New York for both fun <em>and</em> nourishment. In the newest chapter of his life, Loew realizes he doesn't need special powers to be happy and manages to find the two things he was missing all along - love, and himself.</p>

			<p><strong>FILM NOTE:</strong> Insisting on actual, surgically-implanted vampire teeth for his performance, and acting the entire movie in a pseudo-Transylvanian accent (instead of whatever the hell that was in the original movie), Nicolas Cage gives the performance of a lifetime!</p>

			<h4 class="text-center">Honeymoon in Vegas 2</h4>

			<p>After seeing an optometrist for the first time since their wedding adventure, Jack Singer (Nicolas Cage) gets a closer look at his wife Betsy (Sarah Jessica Parker) and impulsively files for divorce. Immediately regretting his decision, and unwilling to throw away decades of a happy marriage for mere (but totally understandable) shallowness, Jack searches for Betsy only to find that she has shacked up with Tommy Korman (James Caan) again, who is now retired in Las Vegas and blind from a freak seagull accident in the Philippines.</p>

			<p>Can Jack convince Tommy that Betsy resembles a ghastly actress from <em>Sex and the City</em> while simultaneously winning her heart back? This time he is willing to gamble everything...</p>
