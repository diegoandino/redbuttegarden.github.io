<p class="text-center red">REGISTRATION REQUIRED</p>

<br />

<p class="text-center">Experience drawing with sterling silver (optional gold or copper) on specially treated paper. This classic technique was used by Leonardo Da Vinci and produces unsurpassed incredible detail.</p>


<h4 class="text-center green">MATERIALS LIST</h4>

 <p class="text-center bold">Artists should bring an enlarged photo of a favorite flower or plant, SIZE 5x7 or 5x5 to be traced and transferred to Color-aid paper I will provide. Artists can apply pastel color with Carb Othello pastel pencils(optional) if desired before rendering with silverpoint
</p>
<p>PENCILS</p>
<uL>
  <li>Graphite: HB and 2H</li>
  <li>Pastel pencils:   I use Stabilo CarbOthello as they can easily be dry blended and smudged AND are Aquarellable making them a multi media medium. They are available locally at Blick/Utrecht art supplies in Sugarhouse as single pencils, 1.33 apiece. Buy 1-4 colors to match some of the flower colors in your photo</li>
</uL>
<p>LEAD HOLDER</p>
<uL>
  <li> “clutch” lead holder which is a form of mechanical pencil. Push down on the top and
        little steel claws emerge from tip and grab leads or silver wire. Buy a 2mm Clutch lead holder available at Blick/Utrecht art supply in Sugarhouse for under $10  which will accomodate  a 3”length of 12 gauge silver wire. Silver wire provided in class.
</li>
</uL>
<p>PAPER</p>
<uL>
  <li>9X12 or larger pad or sheets of Tracing  paper. “Canson” brand is the most translucent</li>
  <li>White or a pastel colored“Color-aid” paper will be provided for your flower/plant artwork. Artist choice.</li>
  <li>Sheets of “Color-aid” paper can be purchased at  www.coloraid.com.  “Color-aid” paper is one of the best surfaces for silverpoint and the paper is not available in Salt Lake City. Small sample packs are available but not full sheets.</li>
</uL>
<p>We will also explore other surfaces using silverpoint “ground” which can be brushed onto other surfaces..
</p>
<p>OTHER</p>

  <li>Scotch “Removable” magic tape (in blue plaid holder) available in office supply stores.</li>
