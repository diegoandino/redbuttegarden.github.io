<p class="text-center">Would you like to harvest your first tomato before August? Are there heirloom varieties you can’t find in local garden centers that you want to grow? Then join instructor Golden Reeves, aka, the Tomato King, as he uncovers the secrets of basic seed propagation, discusses tips for successful tomato gardening, and shares his proven techniques to extend the growing season.</p>

<p class="text-center">Participants will plant and take home a flat of tomato and pepper seeds for germinating at home, as well as receive three Wall O' Waters so tomatoes can be planted in your garden before the last frost. Combined with Golden’s tips, the supplies you take home will have you harvesting delicious tomatoes all summer long.</p>
