<p class="text-center">Create a uniquely beautiful, living, succulent mosaic “picture”.  These versatile mosaics can add variety to your garden, become the dramatic centerpiece for a special occasion, or an accent for a door.  We’ll provide the frame, moss, and succulent plants, as well as cover care and maintenance of your living picture. Class meets in the Red Butte Garden greenhouses.</p>
