<p class="text-center"><strong>REGISTRATION REQUIRED</strong></p>

<p class="text-center">Artists will continue with Scientific Illustration-2 by constructing a voucher or plant sheet using a live plant to sketch and draw the habit and a fruit with seeds and flower to dissect, draw, label and measure. All plant parts will be drawn on tracing paper, transferred to Brisrol and inked and cut out and arranged on the 11x17 sheets from the NHMU Herbarium, you will take finished sheet to office max and have copies made on copier using 11x17 size paper.  we are unable to freeze dry the plant parts we will work from. This will be an interesting and valuable experience of composing a scientific sheet or voucher with a more hands on experience with plant parts to work from.</p>
