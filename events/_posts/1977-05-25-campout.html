<!--<p class="text-center bold">Thank you for making the 2017 Campouts a success! Check back next spring for the 2018 Campout dates.</p>-->

<!--<p class="text-center red">Registration now open!
  <br>Space is limited, so register early!</p>-->

<p class="text-center red">Registration opens Friday, June 1!</p>

<br />

<p class="text-center">Have you ever wondered what happens at the Garden when the last guest leaves? The only way to find out is at one of our campouts! Bring your tent, camping gear, and a picnic dinner to enjoy an overnight, low-stress camping experience complete with flushing toilets and running water. Spend the evening relaxing at your campsite or join us for the bevy of interactive family adventures we have planned including games, crafts, s’mores, and more. We’ll also provide a scrumptious, catered breakfast by <stong>Waffle Love</stong> Saturday morning to complete your camping adventure. You haven’t camped until you’ve camped Red Butte Garden style!</p>

<p class="text-center">Registration required for all participants. All ages welcome. Registration not required for children under the age of 3. Registration available online only. </p>
<p class="text-center">Friday night dinner, tents, or other camping gear <strong>NOT</strong> provided, please plan to bring your own.</p>
<!--<p class="text-center img-center">Saturday morning breakfast for both campouts graciously provided by <a href="http://hruskaskolaches.com/">Hruska's Kolaches</a>.<br><a href="http://hruskaskolaches.com/"><img src="/images/misc/hruskas-kolaches-logo.jpg" alt="Hruska's Kolaches"></a> </p>-->
