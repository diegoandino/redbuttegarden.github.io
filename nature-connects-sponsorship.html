<h4 class="text-center green">Please join us in presenting a botanical garden exhibition that has thrilled audiences around the world. </h4>

<h4 class="text-center green">Nature Connects&reg;: Art with LEGO&reg; Bricks is an award-winning exhibition by world-renowned artist Sean Kenney.</h4>
<br />

<p class="text-center">Are you looking for ways to support the community while simultaneously promoting goodwill for your company? Do you have an employee, child, grandchild, friend, or family member you’d like to honor by sponsoring a sculpture in their name? Or do you just love monarch butterflies, rototillers, or giant eagles made of thousands of LEGO bricks? If so, become a Nature Connects sponsor!</p>

<p class="text-center">Red Butte Garden seeks sponsors to support an extraordinary exhibition for the young and young-at-heart of the Wasatch Front. With an array of incredible LEGO brick themed events, programs, and activities scheduled during the exhibit, there will be something new to keep Garden guests coming back all summer long.</p>

<p class="text-center">Visit the <a href="/nature-connects-new/"> Nature Connects: Art with LEGO Bricks</a> exhibition page to see all the fun events planned!</p>
