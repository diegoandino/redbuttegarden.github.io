<p class="text-center">Students and teachers love this inquiry based, hands-on science program. Created in 2001, the Grow Lab Program is designed around the Wisconsin Fast Plant, which matures from seed to seed in 40 days. Each student plants their own plant and learns about plant parts, germination, flowering, pollination, fruit development, and seed dispersal. The Grow Lab Program is provided at NO COST to Utah’s 1st grade teachers in public and charter schools. The program includes a teacher workshop, a grow lab light frame kit, planting materials and Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds, an eight lesson curriculum, materials for hands-on activities, a classroom plant poster, a classroom visit, and ongoing support. Materials, supplies, and staff time are valued at over $500.</p>

		<h3 class="text-center green">1st Grade Lesson Plans and Materials</h3>
		<p class="text-center">This eight-lesson curriculum is designed to teach segments of Utah’s new integrated core curriculum in science, language art, math, and visual arts. Activities are for inquiry based, hands-on teaching and learning.
		The curriculum is given to the teachers at the teacher workshop. Every teacher who attends the workshop and arranges for a classroom visit will receive all the supplies and materials needed to teach the lessons the first year. Most of the original materials can be used year after year.</p>
		
		A Red Butte Garden staff member comes to your classroom, teaches the first lesson on seed structure and germination, and plants the Wisconsin Fast Plant seeds with the students. The lesson is 90 minutes long.

	<h3 class="text-center green">Teacher Commitment</h3>
	<p class="text-center">Teachers should be ready to have fun! Students love studying the plant that they have grown from seed, and this program makes it easy! Teachers are required to attend the workshop, assist the Red Butte Garden staff member during the classroom visit, complete the lesson plan, and continue to use the Grow Lab year after year. Because the lesson plans are designed around the growth cycle of the Wisconsin Fast Plants, the lessons must be completed in sequential order within the 40-day time period. Teachers are also required to complete a program evaluation after their first year.</p>
