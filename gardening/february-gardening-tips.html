		<p>This is the time of year to plan for spring and summer planting.Think water-wise or drought tolerant plants.There are a large number of trees, shrubs, perennials and even some annuals that will grow with less water. See your nursery professional or horticulturist for their recommendations. Starting in April the Garden will be offering numerous classes, workshops and other native plant events. Some of which are about water- wise techniques and drought tolerant plants.</p>

		<p>Continue to water broadleaf evergreens to prevent leaves from drying out during periods of bright sunshine or windy conditions.</p>

		<p>Want a breath of spring? Force branches into early bloom such as forsythia, cherry, quince, plum, eastern redbud, lilac, magnolia, serviceberry or other early flowering trees and shrubs. Place the cut branches in water in a bright, sunlit place to trigger early flowering.</p>

		<p>Even without snow to cover their food sources, birds will continue to enjoy supplemental food and water, so keep birdfeeders and water troughs filled.</p>

		<p>Late February is usually the best time to prune most fruit trees. For information on how to prune specific fruit varieties, seek professional advice from Utah State University Extension at <strong>468-3170-ext. 1</strong>.</p>

		<p>Now is a good time to start indoor seeds for later, outdoor planting. And if you want to know more about starting plants from seed and have fun at the same time, enroll in RedButte Garden's spring propagation workshop. Check our Calendar for upcoming Classes.</p>
