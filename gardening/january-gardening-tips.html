      <li>If you want your amaryllis to bloom again next year follow these simple steps: After blooming cut back the flower spike close to the base of the bulb. The leaves should be left intact since they are making food for next year's flowers. Place in bright light and continue to water and fertilize monthly. After last frost in spring, you can move your amaryllis outdoors for the summer. Continue to water and fertilize. Mid September allow the soil to completely dry, cut back the foliage and place the bulb in a paper bag and store in a cool dark area for a rest period of 6 - 8 weeks. After the rest period you can repot the amaryllis bulb and it should bloom again in 10 - 12 weeks.</li>
      <li>Plant paperwhite bulbs every other week for continuous flowers.</li>
      <li>Birds will welcome both food and water during freezing temperatures and when the ground is covered with snow. You might even consider purchasing a water-heater designed to keep birdbaths free of ice.</li>
      <li>Send your Christmas tree to the local recycle center so the tree can be shredded into mulch for use in the garden, or put it in the yard so birds can use the tree as a habitat. Add some pinecones smeared with peanut butter or other bird delectables and you've got a natural bird feeder.</li>
      <li>Prevent evergreen branches from breaking by shaking or brushing off heavy wet snow.</li>
      <li>This is a good time to order seeds from catalogues so you will be ready for planting when the weather permits.</li>
      <li>If de-icers are used on icy walks and driveways, use products that will not harm animals, turf grasses, and other plants.</li>
      <li>Got the winter-time blues? Take a short trip to your local nursery or greenhouse to see something green, growing, and in flower. The Orangerie at Red Butte Garden is a great place to relax, enjoy the view of the city and the unique plants growing there.</li>
