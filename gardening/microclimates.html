		<p>A microclimate is an area within a landscape where the weather is considerably warmer or cooler than the surrounding area. A microclimate is created by an assortment of natural and artificial features such as screens that protect plants from the wind, paved surfaces and south facing walls that capture and radiate heat, and low lying areas that capture cold air. A warmer microclimate in the landscape gives gardeners the flexibility to plant landscape plants of a warmer climate zone. For example, microclimates in your zone 5 garden may allow you to expand your plant palate and incorporate plants of zone 6 and maybe even an occasional zone 7 plant.</p>
