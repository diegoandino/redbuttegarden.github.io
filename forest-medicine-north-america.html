<br />

Exciting changes are underway in the Dr. Ezekiel and Edna Wattis Dumke Medicinal Garden. Nestled in the middle of Red Butte Gardenâ€™s three Terrace Gardens, between the Fragrance and Herb Gardens, this space is home to plants known or believed to have medicinal properties.
The Medicinal Garden was originally built and planted in 1996 around a planetree (Platanus), under which, according to legend, Hippocrates taught his pupils the art of medicine on the Greek island of Kos.
