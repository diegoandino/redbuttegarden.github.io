    <p>Most people think about endangered species as animals, but Red Butte Garden is working to save Utah’s endangered plant species. The Red Butte Garden Conservation Department spends much of its time focused on small and inconspicuous desert plants.</p>

    <p>In honor of Endangered Species Day on May 20, 2017, we would like to highlight some of our conservation efforts.</p>

    <p>Currently Utah has 11 plant species listed as Endangered, and 14 species listed as Threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Every year, Red Butte Garden Plant Conservation Department staff members and volunteers go into the field to monitor populations of, and collect seeds from these species.</p>

    <p>The information we gather is summarized in reports and the seeds are stored in a seed bank. Seed banking is a long-term method for conserving the genetic diversity of each plant species. We perform germination testing and propagate some of these species at the Garden, and provide live plants and seeds to other researchers around the state for purposes of scientific study or restoration.</p>

    <p>Many of the species we work with are endemic to a certain soil type or habitat within our state — which means that in the entire world they can only be found in Utah!</p>

    <p>By researching these unique and special plants, Red Butte Garden is helping to preserve an important part of Utah’s natural heritage for generations to come.</p>
