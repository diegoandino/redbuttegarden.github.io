<p>As the snow melts and the garden begins to bloom, life awakens at Red Butte. Our collections of conifers, roses, daffodils, and more are alive with the spirit of spring. The garden has never looked so good!</p>

<p>As our garden changes colors and forms, so has our website. We at Red Butte have worked hard to create a refreshed and streamlined way for you to access our events and information. The new site brings a modern design, enhanced functionality, and a mobile optimized experience for visitors on the go. We hope you enjoy it!</p>
