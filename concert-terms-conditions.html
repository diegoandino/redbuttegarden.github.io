<h3 class="green">Online Ticketing and Ticketing by Phone</h3>

<p>For security purposes, the name on the credit card must match the name of the person placing the ticket order.</p>

<p>Tickets ordered Online or by Phone and held in Will Call may be picked up at the Garden’s Visitor Center during regular business hours or at the Will Call booth near the Amphitheatre entrance on the day of the concert.</p>

<p>Tickets held in Will Call will only be released to the original purchaser. A photo ID is required for tickets to be released.</p>

<p>All orders are assessed a $5.00 per order processing fee. Other fees may apply depending upon how tickets are ordered.</p>

<p>All tickets ordered online will be confirmed in a confirmation page and/or in an e-mail with a confirmation number. If you do not receive a confirmation number after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, you must contact Red Butte Garden to confirm that your order has been (or has not been) placed. Red Butte Garden assumes no responsibility for orders that do not receive a confirmation number.</p>

<p>Red Butte Garden does not warrant that your use of the online ticketing system will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, that defects will be corrected, or that either the site, or the server(s) on which the site is hosted are free of viruses or other harmful components. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, suspend or discontinue any part of this Site at any time, with or without notice. We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to impose limits on certain features and services and to restrict access to any part or to all of the Site.</p>

<h3 class="green">"Ticket Limits,” “Scalping of Tickets,” and Other Prohibited Ticketing Activities</h3>

<p>Purchasers are limited to a specified number of tickets for each concert (also known as a "ticket limit"). This ticket limit is posted during the purchase process and is verified with every transaction. This policy is in effect to discourage unfair ticket buying practices.</p>

<p>It is a violation of Red Butte Garden’s ticketing policies to exceed the ticket limit. Ticket purchasers may not use automated means to purchase or place tickets and may not use multiple Internet Protocol addresses or email addresses to conceal their identity.
It is a violation of Red Butte Garden’s ticketing policies for ticket buyers to resell tickets for more than their face value (“scalping”). Anyone who is caught scalping tickets may have all of their Red Butte Garden concert tickets revoked, and may be barred from purchasing any tickets in the future. Any University of Utah employee or student caught scalping Red Butte Garden concert tickets will be referred to the appropriate University disciplinary process. Any visitor to the University of Utah campus who is caught scalping tickets is in violation of University of Utah Rule R1-1007B and, after having their tickets confiscated, may be ordered to leave University of Utah property pursuant to <strong>Utah Criminal Code § 76-8-703</strong>. A person who fails to leave University property after being ordered to do so, or who re-enters the property after being ordered to leave, is guilty of criminal trespass.</p>

<p>Individuals who exceed the ticket limit or engage in ticket scalping or other prohibited ticketing activities may have their pending ticket orders cancelled and may be banned from using the Site and from purchasing tickets to future Red Butte Garden activities. If we are unable to verify or authenticate any information, ordering, purchase, ticket posting, sale, authentication, payment or remittance process, or any other process, or if we are no longer able to verify or authorize your credit card or bank account information, your tickets may be cancelled.</p>

<h3 class="green">Refunds and Exchanges</h3>

<p>All ticket sales are final. BEFORE PURCHASING TICKETS, CAREFULLY REVIEW YOUR CONCERT DATE AND SHOW TIME. Shows are rain or shine. Red Butte Garden will not exchange tickets and will only refund tickets in the event that a show is cancelled. Individuals who attempt to circumvent this “no refund” policy by disputing or otherwise seeking a "chargeback" from the credit card company used to purchase tickets may be prohibited from purchasing tickets to future Red Butte Garden concerts.</p>

<p>Red Butte Garden is not responsible for tickets purchased from a third-party ticketer and will not issue refunds for tickets purchased through third parties.</p>

<p>Red Butte Garden is not responsible for and/or will not replace any ticket that is lost, damaged, or destroyed.</p>

<p>If Red Butte Garden cancels a concert, a refund will be issued to the purchaser.</p>

<h3 class="green">Cancelled and Postponed Concerts</h3>

<p>Red Butte Garden reserves the right to cancel concerts for any reason. If an concert is cancelled, and you purchased your ticket through Red Butte Garden, a refund will be issued to the purchaser as described above. Red Butte Garden’s only liability for a cancelled concert shall be to refund the ticket purchase price.
Opening acts, co-headliners or guests may sometimes tour with headlining performers. Red Butte Garden is not always made aware of opening acts or the length of their performances. These opening acts are subject to change or cancellation at any time without notice. No refund will be owed if an opening act or a co-headliner is changed or cancelled.
Red Butte Garden reserves the right to change the location of a concert and to reschedule the date of a concert. Changes to the location or date of the concert do not automatically entitle the ticket holder to a refund. Please contact us for more information or to request a refund if you cannot attend a rescheduled concert. Please make sure to include/provide your membership and/or order number so we can expedite your refund if applicable.
