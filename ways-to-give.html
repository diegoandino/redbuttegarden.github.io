		<h3 class="green">Water Conservation Garden Donation</h3>

		<p>With a generous challenge grant from The Alternative Visions Fund, and the help of many donors, Red Butte Garden was able to build our new three-acre Water Conservation Garden. Construction began in April 2015 and was completed in 2017. We are still accepting contributions to be used for educational materials, interpretive signage, and a Water Conservation Garden endowment fund.</p>

		<h3 class="green">Education and Programs Donation</h3>

		<p>In the past year, approximately 25,000 school children participated in our acclaimed educational outreach programs and school field trips. During the summer, children attend camps where they learn about bugs, cooking, prehistoric plants and many other exciting topics! First-graders across the state participate in our Grow Lab Program where they learn to plant and care for seeds in their own classrooms. We are also pleased to announce the success and continued development of the Botany Bin Program. In addition, the Garden offers over 50 classes each year for adults and families.</p>
