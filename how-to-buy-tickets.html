				<p class="text-center">The Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre has a capacity of 3000, this means that only 3000 tickets are available to any show. We currently have more Garden Members than we have tickets available, so some concerts may sell out quickly—sometimes in less than 10 minutes.</p>

				<p class="text-center">Before buying tickets, we suggest that you do a couple things to prepare:<br />
				Make sure your Garden membership is current and know which email you assigned to that membership and set up a Ticketfly account in advance.</p>

				<p class="text-center"><strong>Red Butte Garden uses an external ticketing system called Ticketfly.</strong><br />

				<p class="text-center">Many artist contracts specify that we are to hold a small number of general admission tickets for the artist to sell directly to their fan club. These tickets are available only on the artist’s official web site, and only for a short period of time. In addition to any fan club membership fees, tickets are offered at the full public price. Garden Members are welcome to purchase these tickets by joining the fan club, but they will not receive the Garden Member discount on those tickets. Red Butte Garden does not control when these tickets go on sale.</p>

	  <div id="reseller" class="panel-collapse collapse">
	    <div class="panel-body">

				<p class="text-center">We do not partner with any ticket resellers and do not recommend purchasing tickets through resellers. Unfortunately, ticket reselling is legal in the state of Utah, so we cannot completely prevent reselling, however, we do monitor ticket limits and will cancel orders with ticket numbers above the allotted limits. No reseller has tickets to any of our concerts before the Garden Member presale date. Some ticket brokers have signed up for Garden Memberships but they must purchase their tickets just like other Garden Members with the same limitations on the number of tickets that can be purchased. If you purchase a ticket from a reseller, please be aware that the ticket will be overpriced and may be invalid. We cannot verify that a ticket is valid until the ticket is scanned at the entrance gate on the night of the concert. It may be a ticket number that was sold twice, meaning that it will scan as USED and you may be denied entry into the venue or you may have purchased a ticket that was cancelled due to a ticket limit violation. Red Butte Garden cannot look up or reprint tickets purchased through a reseller. </p>

	    <div class="panel-body">

				<p class="text-center"><strong class="red">These ticket sites DO NOT have tickets!</strong> Online sites that claim to have Red Butte Garden concert tickets before they go on sale to our Garden Members do not actually have tickets in hand. They claim to have tickets, and hope to acquire them through normal or other channels before the concert date (buying them from the public, or by being a Garden member, subject to ticket limits). It’s a gamble. A good clue is if the ticket for sale is overpriced and has language that says something like “ticket will be delivered by XX date,”- this usually means they do not have a ticket and that they will try to acquire one if they have found a potential buyer. The recommended course of action is to not use these sites and ONLY purchase tickets directly from Red Butte Garden, Ticketfly, or an artist’s official fan club. This is the only way to be sure you get authentic, face-value priced tickets.</p>

				<p class="text-center">Be aware that third-party ticket vendors and scalpers use the words 'Red Butte Garden' in some way to sell tickets. We recommend that you only purchase your tickets online through <a href="www.redbuttegarden.org">www.redbuttegarden.org</a>, <a href="www.ticketfly.com">www.ticketfly.com</a>, or <a href="www.redbuttegarden.ticketfly.com">www.redbuttegarden.ticketfly.com</a>.</p>

				<p class="text-center">Purchasers of Red Butte Garden concert and event tickets may not resell their tickets for more than the face value of the ticket ("scalping"). Purchasers who are caught scalping their tickets may be subject to ejection from the Red Butte Garden event, may have their tickets confiscated, and may be banned from the future purchase of tickets to Red Butte Garden events. <a href="/concert-terms-conditions/">CLICK HERE to see all of the Terms &amp; Conditions that apply to your concert ticket ("license").</a></p>
