						<li>Gift Memberships can be purchased <a href="https://55218.blackbaudhosting.com/55218/Garden-Membership">ONLINE</a>, by phone at <b>801-585-7172</b>, or in person at the RBG Visitor Center. <span style="color:#FF0000;">Gift Memberships cannot be purchased through the mail.</span></li>

				</p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q3">When can I expect to receive my membership card? </h4>
				<p>Please allow three to four weeks for your card to arrive, but don’t wait to enjoy the Garden! During the processing period you may continue to visit by simply showing a photo ID at the RBG Visitor Center. </p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q4">How often do membership prices increase? Why?</h4>
				<p>Membership rates increase every two to three years. Periodically assessing the membership program and increasing rates allows the Garden to both provide an excellent experience to members and ensure prices cover the increasing cost of fulfilling membership benefits. </p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q5">In 2015 I had an Individual or Dual Membership, what level is a good fit for me now that those levels have changed? </h4>
				<p>The new level, <span class="memhighlight">Garden-Plus</span>, is perfect for you! <span class="memhighlight">Garden-Plus</span> is a hybrid of <span class="memhighlight">Individual</span> and <span class="memhighlight">Dual</span>. With this membership you may either bring one unnamed guest each visit, or you may name a second person a cardholder. If you choose to name a second cardholder, any guests you bring will need to pay admission, even if the second cardholder is not present. </p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q6">If I name a second cardholder on my <span class="memhighlight">Garden-Plus</span> membership, may I still bring guests to the Garden? </h4>
				<p>No, once a second cardholder is named, only cardholders have free admission. </p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q7">What is the difference between a <span class="memhighlight">Family</span> and a <span class="memhighlight">Family-Plus</span> Membership? </h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>A <span class="memhighlight">Family</span> membership allows for two cardholders and free admission for up to six children, age 17 and under, each visit. This level is perfect for parents or grandparents who bring their family to the Garden frequently.</li>
						<li>A <span class="memhighlight">Family-Plus</span> membership allows for a third cardholder. Family-Plus is a great solution for families whose caregivers may bring their children to the Garden when their guardians are at work or other priorities.</li>
					</ul> 
				</p>
				
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q8">Can I bring play dates to the Garden with my Family / Family-Plus Membership?</h4>
				<p><span class="memhighlight">Family</span> and <span class="memhighlight">Family-Plus </span>memberships are perfect for play dates! Each membership allows for up to six unnamed children each visit. Just remember that additional children or any adults who are not cardholders will be charged an admission fee. </p>
				<br />
				<h4 id="Q9">I want to bring additional guests to the Garden. How do I get/use my 50% off guest coupons?</h4>
				<p>Your 50% off Guest Coupons will be included in your welcome package with your membership card. You must bring the physical coupon to the Garden for your guest to receive 50% off admission. </p>
				<p><b>Each Membership level qualifies for the following number of 50% off Guest Coupons: </b><br/>
					<ul>
						<li><span class="memhighlight">Garden-Basic</span> – 2</li>
						<li><span class="memhighlight">Garden-Plus</span> – 2</li>

				<h4 id="Q10">I have decided I want a higher level, how can I upgrade my membership? </h4>
