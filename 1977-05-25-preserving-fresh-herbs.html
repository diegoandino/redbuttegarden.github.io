<p class="text-center red">You know how much flavor the fresh herbs you grow add to your summer meals. But did you know that through proper harvesting and preservation techniques, you can enjoy the essence of that flavor and fragrance all winter long? In this class you'll learn the optimal time to harvest your herbs, techniques for preserving them for later use, and the basics of cooking with both fresh and dried herbs. A tour of Red Butte Garden's herb garden and tasty snacks made with herbs will round out our experience. Co-sponsored with Lifelong Learning; members pay $40 + sp fee, register for section 002.</p>
