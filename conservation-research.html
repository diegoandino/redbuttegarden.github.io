		<h3 class="green text-center">Conservation in a Nutshell</h3>
		<p>The Red Butte Garden Conservation Department spends much of its time focused on small and inconspicuous desert plants. Every once in a while, someone asks why. The short answer is biodiversity.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-sm-4">
	
		<h3 class="green text-center">What is biodiversity?</h3>
		<p>Biodiversity is the number of different species of plants and animals found within a particular region, or ecosystem. The more diverse an ecosystem, meaning the more plants, animals, insects, and bacteria living within it, the healthier it is. A diverse ecosystem has more resources to draw on that allow it to bounce back from disturbances, adapt to long-term changes, and support the communities within it, wild or cultivated.</p>
		
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-sm-4">
	
		<h3 class="green text-center">Why does it matter?</h3>
		<p>While biodiversity is critical for the sake of the environment in and of itself, there are a number of reasons biodiversity should matter to our species. To focus just on plant diversity: plants provide us with key ingredients and products that feed us, shelter us, keep us healthy, and fuel our economy. To destroy a species, actively or unknowingly, is to destroy its potential for tomorrow and for generations to come.

	<div class="col-sm-4">
	
		<h3 class="green text-center">What are our goals?</h3>
		<p>We are stewards of the at-risk plants in our region, and protecting them is a key component of Red Butte Garden’s mission. We hope to mitigate threats and preserve genetic information so that rare populations may recover in their native habitats, thereby conserving the diversity of our native flora.</p>

		<h3 class="green text-center">What kind of work do we do?</h3>
		<p>We conduct research that informs our understanding of regional rare plant populations and the threats they face.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-sm-4">
	
		<p><strong>In-situ conservation</strong> is work that is done on site, in the area where the plant naturally grows. We collect plant samples and seeds to study later, monitor populations, transplant endangered species out of harm’s way, and re-vegetate with seeds or seedlings in their native habitats.</p>
	
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-sm-4">
	
		<p><strong>Ex-situ conservation</strong> is work that is done off site, at our garden facility or other facilities around the West. This work involves storing seeds in seed banks to preserve the genetic material, testing seed germination and viability to better understand how to propagate a species, and caring for living specimens that have been propagated or salvaged from project sites.</p>

					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing</p>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We are using a new automated motion-capture technology <a href="http://www.tumblingdice.co.uk/rana">(Rana)</a> to track and record pollinator activity on selected native plant species. This project will allow us to determine the diversity and frequency of insect visits on certain types of flowers, and help answer important questions about pollinator services and "pollinator-friendly" plants in Utah. We set up cameras at the Rio Mesa Center outside of Moab, UT as well as the Natural Area and Children's Garden here at Red Butte Garden, and recorded visits of many different kinds of native bees, butterflies, and even hummingbirds.

					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing</p>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Each year we survey an ecological region for abundant, native plants from which seed can be collected. In 2015, we completed nearly 30 collections totaling 1.2 million seeds from 14 native Great Basin plant species. Seeds are stored at the Bend Seed Extractory for future use in habitat restoration and rehabilitation. Herbarium specimens are also collected, which are divvied up between Red Butte Garden, the University of Utah, Brigham Young University, and the Smithsonian Institute. <a href="https://seedsofsuccess.smugmug.com/Bureau-of-Land-Management/BLM-CP2/">Click here</a> for photo highlights from past SOS Collection years!</p>

					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Completed in 2015</p>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> We surveyed habitat surrounding the Endangered Gierisch's globemallow (Sphaeralcea gierischii) population in Arizona to piece together the rehabilitation history of post-gypsum mining landforms. We compared vegetation structure and composition between rehab and adjacent undisturbed control sites to examine the effects of past practices, seed mixes and the gypsum-rich substrate on the success of restoration in this area.</p>

					<p><strong>Partner:</strong> BLM and Center for Plant Conservation (CPC)</p>
					<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Ongoing</p>
					<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Seed banking is a long-term method for conserving the diversity of plant species. Seeds of rare, threatened and endangered plants are collected and stored with low moisture content at low temperatures, thereby extending their lifespan. These collections preserve genetic material away from the threat of habitat destruction. We store a portion of seed in our on-site seed bank; another portion is sent to the <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=54-02-05-00">National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation</a> in Fort Collins, CO.</p>

					<p><strong>Duration: </strong>Ongoing</p>
					<p><strong>Summary: </strong>At the garden, we are currently testing seeds from our seed bank in order to develop the best protocols for germinating rare plant species. Once seeds have germinated, we maintain them in our greenhouses and track their growth each month in order to pinpoint the best methods for propagation. Many of the species we work with require very specific conditions for growth, and by sustaining these species in our greenhouses, we can determine the feasibility of growing seedlings for future outplanting and restoration studies. <a href="http://redbuttegarden.org/current-projects/lestum">Learn more about our current trials here!</a></p>

					<p><strong>Partner: </strong>BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</p>
					<p><strong>Duration: </strong>Completed in 2015</p>
					<p><strong>Summary: </strong>We conducted in-situ germination studies at a trial reintroduction site to assess the feasibility of reintroducing this species to rehabilitated mining substrates from seed. We monitored seedling establishment and tracked seedling survivorship from 2013-2015 on study sites in Arizona. We also collected seed for long-term ex-situ conservation and developed greenhouse propagation protocols. This species was listed as endangered in 2013, a decision that was informed by our data.</p>

					<p><strong>Summary: </strong>Over the ten consecutive years of this monitoring project, we have collected demographic and population trend data from these species to inform management decisions.
