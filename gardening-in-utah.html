						<p>If you want your amaryllis to bloom again next year follow these simple steps:</p>
						
						<p>After blooming cut back the flower spike close to the base of the bulb. The leaves should be left intact since they are making food for next year's flowers. Place in bright light and continue to water and fertilize monthly. After last frost in spring, you can move your amaryllis outdoors for the summer. Continue to water and fertilize. Mid September allow the soil to completely dry, cut back the foliage and place the bulb in a paper bag and store in a cool dark area for a rest period of 6 - 8 weeks. After the rest period you can repot the amaryllis bulb and it should bloom again in 10 - 12 weeks.</p>
						
						<p>Plant paperwhite bulbs every other week for continuous flowers.</p>
						
						<p>Birds will welcome both food and water during freezing temperatures and when the ground is covered with snow. You might even consider purchasing a water-heater designed to keep birdbaths free of ice.</p>
						
						<p>Send your Christmas tree to the local recycle center so the tree can be shredded into mulch for use in the garden, or put it in the yard so birds can use the tree as a habitat. Add some pinecones smeared with peanut butter or other bird delectables and you've got a natural bird feeder.</p>
						
						<p>Prevent evergreen branches from breaking by shaking or brushing off heavy wet snow.</p>
						
						<p>This is a good time to order seeds from catalogues so you will be ready for planting when the weather permits.</p>
						
						<p>If de-icers are used on icy walks and driveways, use products that will not harm turf grasses and other plants.</p>
						
						<p>Got the winter-time blues? Take a short trip to your local nursery or greenhouse to see something green, growing, and in flower.The Orangerie at Red Butte Garden is a great place to relax, enjoy the view of the city and the unique plants growing there.</p>

						<p>This is the time of year to plan for spring and summer planting.Think water-wise or drought tolerant plants.There are a large number of trees, shrubs, perennials and even some annuals that will grow with less water. See your nursery professional or horticulturist for their recommendations. Starting in April the Garden will be offering numerous classes, workshops and other native plant events. Some of which are about water- wise techniques and drought tolerant plants.</p>
						
						<p>Continue to water broadleaf evergreens to prevent leaves from drying out during periods of bright sunshine or windy conditions.</p>
						
						<p>Want a breath of spring? Force branches into early bloom such as forsythia, cherry, quince, plum, eastern redbud, lilac, magnolia, serviceberry or other early flowering trees and shrubs. Place the cut branches in water in a bright, sunlit place to trigger early flowering.</p>
						
						<p>Even without snow to cover their food sources, birds will continue to enjoy supplemental food and water, so keep birdfeeders and water troughs filled.</p>
						
						<p>Late February is usually the best time to prune most fruit trees. For information on how to prune specific fruit varieties, seek professional advice from Utah State University Extension at 468-3170-ext. 1.</p>
						
						<p>Now is a good time to start indoor seeds for later, outdoor planting. And if you want to know more about starting plants from seed and have fun at the same time, enroll in RedButte Garden's spring propagation workshop. Check our Calendar for upcoming Classes.</p>

						<p>Prune trees and shrubs that were damaged by heavy snow. It's also a good time to plant trees. Check out our classes "Unique Trees for Utah Landscapes" and/or "Fabulous Fruit Trees" this spring.</p>
						
						<p>Cut back ornamental grasses and perennials that weren't pruned in the fall.</p>
						
						<p>Start seeds of vegetables and annual flowers indoors under fluorescent lights for late May - June planting outdoors.</p>
						
						<p>Core aerate lawn area if heavily compacted once soil dries.</p>
						
						<p>Apply pre-emergent herbicide for crab grass control between March 15 - April 15.</p>
						
						<p>Cool season vegetables like peas, radish, lettuce, and spinach can be planted as soon as the soil can be worked. Transplants of cool season vegetables like broccoli and cabbage can also be planted as soon as soil can be worked.</p>
						
						<p>Quality soil is the foundation for plants, have soil tested before planting new areas. Soil tests will give you important information like pH, % organic matter, soluble salts, and major nutrients in soil. Recommendations for amendments will also be provided. Soil tests can be obtained from USU Extension.</p>
						
						<p>Design a section of your landscape to be more water efficient. Join us for one of our many water-wise and native plant classes, including "Irrigation Basics" or "Residential Landscape Design."</p>
						
						<p>Plant bare root roses the latter part of the month, soak roots of bare root roses in water several hours before planting</p>
						
						<p>Prune hybrid tea and shrub roses late March to early April removing dead and diseased wood, and crossing branches. Cut remaining branches of hybrid teas back to 16 - 24 inches above ground level. Join the "Rose Pruning Workshop" for hands-on experience.</p>
						
						<p>Force branches of Pussy Willow, Cherry, Quince, and Forsythia to bloom indoors. Prune twigs once flower buds are swollen, place in vase of water and put in sunny warm location.</p>

						<p>April is one of the busiest months in the garden. Here are a few tips for what to do in the garden this month:</p>
						
						<p>Start warm season vegetables and flowers indoors under fluorescent lights for transplanting outdoors mid May after the last frost. Peppers, eggplant, cucumber, squash, and melons can be started indoors now.</p>
						
						<p>Cool season vegetables like peas, radishes, lettuce, spinach can be planted now.</p>
						
						<p>Cut back ornamental grasses to within 2 - 3 inches of the ground, if this wasn't done in March. Cut back herbaceous perennials that weren't cut back in the fall.</p>
						
						<p>Convert a small section of your landscape to drought tolerant plants. Learn more about waterwise landscaping in our short course in April. Check the calendar for details.</p>
						
						<p>Plant trees, shrubs, perennials, and cool season annuals like pansies. Divide and transplant perennials that have become overgrown.</p>
						
						<p>Prune out winter damaged branches and twigs from ornamental plants.</p>
						
						<p>Cool season turf grasses like Kentucky Bluegrass will start to green up. This is a good time to aerate lawns and fertilize using a nitrogen fertilizer. Apply preemergent herbicide to lawn areas to control crabgrass.</p>
						
						<p>Prune hybrid tea roses before they leaf out. Wait to prune climbing and shrub roses until after they bloom.</p>
						
						<p>Check irrigation system for problems.</p>
						
						<p>Deadhead spring blooming bulbs such as daffodils, crocus and tulips but don't cut back leaves until they start to yellow. Check out the beautiful display of blooming bulbs in the Four Seasons Garden at Red Butte Garden this Spring.</p>

						<p>Prune spring-flowering shrubs such as forsythia, lilac, and quince, as soon as the bloom is finished. Remove older stems, broken, dead, or crossing branches.</p>
						
						<p>Watch for aphids on new growth of roses, perennials, and spiraea. Spray them with a strong stream of water or use an insecticidal soap to control the insects.</p>
						
						<p>Plant trees, shrubs, and perennials obtained from the nursery now. The cool weather and spring rain we usually receive is optimal for new plants.</p>
						
						<p>It is not too late to apply a pre-immergent herbicide to control crabgrass and other annual weeds. Be careful not to use the chemical on vegetable garden or flower beds that will be seeded later as the weather warms.</p>
						
						<p>Cut the spent flowerheads of spring flowering bulbs such as daffodils and tulips. Do not cut back the leaves of these plants until the foliage begins to fade and turn brown since the bulbs need the food produced by the leaves to feed the bulb for next year's bloom.</p>
						
						<p>After the first grass mowing of the season, raise mower blades to their proper cutting height. For Kentucky bluegrass and other cool season turf grasses, that is from 2" to 3" inches high. Keeping the turf grass at this height will promote root growth, conserve water, reduce weeds, and provide for a healthier lawn.</p>
						
						<p>Mulch bare ground to conserve moisture and control weeds.</p>
						
						<p>It is not too late to aerate lawns to improve supply of air, water, and nutrients to turf root systems. Power raking should only be done where extreme amounts of thatch have built up in the turf.</p>
						
						<p>As soon as garden beds are dry enough to allow working the soil, apply and dig in compost or peat moss to increase water-holding ability.</p>
						
						<p>Begin setting out hardier potted plants such as geraniums on decks, porches, and patios. Wait until danger of frost is past to pot-up other tender, less hardy plants.

						<p>Conserve water by watering lawns only before 10:00am or after 6:00pm.</p>
						
						<p>Set out all warm season vegetable and annual flower seedlings or plant seeds now.</p>
						
						<p>Watch for slug and snail damage on plants and use prepared bait or other techniques to control the pests.</p>
						
						<p>Continue to apply mulch to garden and vegetable beds. The mulch will help to conserve water and improve soil texture as the mulch decomposes.</p>
						
						<p>Trim dead and dying leaves of spring flowering bulbs.</p>
						
						<p>Grasshopper damage will begin to show on tender young plants. If insecticides are used for control, make sure that directions are closely followed to prevent harm to bees and other beneficial insects.</p>
						
						<p>As summer temperatures climb, don't over-fertilize cool season turf grasses. These grasses perform best during cooler weather, and applying fertilizer in mid summer heat does not benefit turf development.</p>
						
						<p>Control annual weeds before they mature to prevent them from setting and dispersing seed.</p>

						<p>What a great time to be out enjoying the garden and the rewards of all your spring toils. Your garden is full of blossoms and greenery. Barefoot breakfasts on the deck and warm summer evening festivities bring needed respite to our busy lives.</p>
						
						<p>A great way to enjoy your garden is by cutting flowers early in the morning and arranging them for indoor display.</p>
						
						<p>Many flowers are also edible and can dress up your table. Pineapple sage (sweet), nasturtium (peppery), and daylily flowers are all quite tasty.</p>
						
						<p>Keeping gardens and containers watered this time of year becomes a daily challenge. Watering early in the day or in late evening will help the water soak into the soil instead of evaporating. Do not water between the hours of 10:00 am and 6:00 pm.</p>
						
						<p>For automated sprinkler systems this is a good time to see how it is working. Examine each head to see if they are broken or clogged and to make sure heads are turned in the right direction to spray on the flowerbeds. Often we forget about them because they run so early in the morning. If overspray is a problem, often a few turns of the screw in the middle of most heads with shorten the spray distance. If you live in a managed property, let the management company know if you see a broken head.</p>
						
						<p>As plants grow, garden pests and weeds will challenge even the most persistent gardener. Scheduling a specific time or certain number of hours per week to be in your garden can help you keep weeds in check or notice pest problems. Removing younger weeds before the go to seed is easier than removing older ones and reduces future weed populations.</p>
						
						<p>Slugs and snails are a constant problem. Handpicking or beer traps are easy control methods. Another simple trap is to elevate a piece of wood a few inches off the ground in a damp shady area. The slugs and snails will congregate there can be easily gathered and then thrown in the garbage. Use chemical baits only when other treatments fail and be careful so children, pets, and other wildlife do not eat any treatments. Contrary to popular belief, smashing slugs and snails does not spread their eggs.</p>
						
						<p>Many perennials and some annuals will now be finished blooming and are now producing seeds. Many perennials will rebloom if the old flowers and developing seeds are removed, a process called dead heading. The old or spent blossoms should be cut off where the flower stem connects to the leaves usually several inches down in the plant. Since dead-heading also removes unsightly, dry flower heads it also improves the appearance of your garden.</p>
						
						<p>A few perennials like catmint (Nepeta), golden alyssum, and candytuft need extreme dead heading in the form of shearing to about 6 inches to encourage a late summer rebloom. A good reference for perennial care is The Well Tended Perennial Garden by Tracy DiSabato-Aust.</p>
						
						<p>Grass clippings are green gold! Don’t throw them away. When mowing turf-grasses (lawns), use a mulching mower which chops the clippings smaller and leaves them on the lawn. This recycles nutrients back into the turf. You can also use grass clippings as mulch around vegetables, shrubs, and perennials. Clippings are also a great addition to your compost pile. Just keep it stirred to allow the fungi to get some air.</p>
						
						<p>A common garden and lawn weed, black medic, is peaking this time of year. The leaves look similar to clover but with small yellow flowers and grows very close to the ground. When soils are damp, the tap root is easily pulled up by hand. A favorite weeding tool to discourage persistent weeds is a dandelion digger. Check out our gift shop for a wide variety of helpful tools.</p>
						
						<p>Provide an even supply of water to tomatoes to help prevent blossom end rot. Blossom end rot is a symptom of calcium deficiency. It isn’t because there isn’t enough calcium, but that there wasn’t enough water to carry it to the tomato on a regular basis. Routine watering is the best treatment.</p>
						
						<p>Spring flowerings shrubs are now finished and ready to be pruned. These include lilacs, forsythia and spireas. Shrubs benefit the most from “thinning”. This is done by removing several large branches bycutting at the base as close the ground as possible. Three to four large branches is usually sufficient each year. To learn more, our bookstore has several “pruning classics” for sale to give you instruction.</p>
