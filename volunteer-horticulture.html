		<h4> <div class="green">Natural Area Volunteers</div></h4>
	
			<h5>The Natural Area provides volunteers with an opportunity to learn about the habitat and care of native plants in the foothill’s most pristine region by assisting with restoration projects, trail maintenance, invasive species removal, and native seed collection. Other opportunities include planting, pruning, and seasonal greenhouse activities. Working in the Natural Area includes physical labor (hiking, kneeling, bending, lifting, tool use, etc.) and working in a variety of weather conditions. Volunteers must be age 15 years or older - younger volunteers must be approved in advance and accompanied by a parent or guardian. Available: April – October or longer depending on the weather.</h5>
