<p>Did you know that April is National Poetry Month? Each year, the garden </p>

Are you interested in having your poem featured in one of Red Butte Gardenâ€™s eleven poetry boxes this April during National Poetry Month?

Poems will be judged according to the following criteria:
- Inspired by nature
- Relevant to the spring season
- Pertinent to the Garden
- 24 lines or shorter
- Appropriate for all ages

Please submit your entry to LaraLee Smith, laralee.smith@redbutte.utah.edu, on or before Saturday, February 20th. Entries must include the author(s) name, phone number, e-mail address, and poem. Poets should also note whether they are entering the adult (poets aged 18 and over) or youth (poets aged 5 to 17) category. One entry per person.

Chosen authors will be invited to provide an audio recording of themselves performing a reading of their poem and participate in additional programming related to National Poetry Month.

By submitting your poems, the author grants Red Butte Garden a license to publish and reproduce the poem online and in other media.
