<p>Did you know that trees emit organic compounds called phytoncides that help them ward off harmful insects and fungi? Studies in Japan have shown that when we breathe in phytoncides while enjoying the quiet of the forest, our bodies create more cancer fighting proteins and immune support cells.</p>

<p>Japan has 62 official Forest Therapy trails. They call this practice of wandering through forests ‘shinrin-yoku’ which roughly translates to ‘Forest Bathing' or 'Taking in the Forest Atmosphere.’ As of 2012, the country had already devoted four million dollars funding related research.</p>

<p>Shinrin-yoku consists of being meditatively present in the forest through slow movements and focus on the senses.
