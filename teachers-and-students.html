<br />

<p class="text-center">Red Butte Garden serves approximately 25,000 Utah students each school year. Using hands-on, inquiry-based methods, our programs help students connect with plants and the beauty of living landscapes while enhancing the science education standards delivered in the classroom</p>
<p class="text-center">Our goal is to deliver highly effective environmental and horticultural education programs that will have a meaningful and measurable impact on teachers and students of varying grade levels and backgrounds. All programs are offered at no cost to public and charter schools, and discounted for private schools.
</p>
<p class="text-center">We currently offer three different programs for teachers and students! Click on the images below for more information about each.</p>
