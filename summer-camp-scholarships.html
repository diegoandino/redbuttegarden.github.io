<p class="text-center">To apply, complete the Scholarship Application found at the bottom of this webpage. Scholarship applications must be submitted by May 15, 2017.</p>

<p class="text-center">Please note that because funds are limited and demand for camp is high, qualifying for a scholarship does not guarantee a scholarship award. It also does not guarantee a spot in the summer camp of your choice.</p>

<p class="text-center">Parents or guardians are responsible to provide transportation for their child to and from camp each day.</p>

<h5 class="text-center red"><sup>*</sup> If awarded a scholarship, a $5 non-refundable deposit per child is due at the time of registration in order to secure your camperâ€™s spot in camp.</h5>
