			<h3>Why Volunteer at the Garden?</h3>
			<p>Red Butte Garden volunteers represent a remarkably diverse group of individuals. They come from all stages and walks of life, and possess an incredible variety of interests and experiences, yet they all gather here at the Garden to help pursue our mission to cultivate the human connection with the beauty of living landscapes. They give tours, pull weeds, plant perennials and annuals, maintain trails, conserve endangered plants, and lead field trips and summer camps for kids. They welcome excited guests to the Outdoor Concert Series, put on costumes for Garden After Dark, provide helpful information at our Spring and Fall plant sales, and do all of it with astonishing dedication and enthusiasm. </p>
			<p>Red Butte Garden relies on its volunteers and that feeling seems to be mutual; whether it’s peace and solitude or friendship and excitement, our volunteers seem to find what they are looking for here in our 100-acre oasis. If you are looking to meet new people, gain unique experience in an outdoor setting, and be a part of a wonderful community, become a member of the Red Butte Garden Volunteer Program. </p>
			<p>JOIN US! Explore our volunteer opportunities, submit an application, and I will contact you to discuss your interests and availability and to welcome you to the Red Butte Garden volunteer community. </p>
			<p>I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
