      <h4 class="text-left green">Prologue: Quest for the Curiosity Key</h4>

      <p class="text-left">Before embarking on your adventure, pick up your family guide to Wonderland and your Curiosity Key outside the Visitor Center. The Curiosity Key is an enchanted key that unlocks the Looking Glass (a magic portal you can use to leave Wonderland and return to the real world).
        <br>
        <br> Unfortunately, your key is missing its four magic gems. Complete a task for each citizen of Wonderland you encounter throughout the night and they’ll reward you with a gem to complete your key. Can you collect all four gems and return home before the night is over?</p>
        <hr>

    <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 1: Down the Rabbit Hole</h4>

    <p class="text-left">Follow the White Rabbit down the rabbit hole to discover the magic entrance to Wonderland. Keep your eyes open for flying clocks, floating bookshelves, magic keys, and more as you travel from the real world to the wondrous world of Wonderland. What secrets about the natural world will you uncover along the way?</p>

<hr>
    <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 2: Conversation with the Caterpillar</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Filled with wisdom and sage advice, no trip to Wonderland is complete without a visit to the Caterpillar, Wonderland’s resident mushroom and fungi expert. Start your quest to complete your Curiosity Key by investigating some of the strange, unusual, and downright magical fungi found in the Caterpillar’s collection. Then, use what you’ve learned to decorate your own incredible shrinking mushroom charm to earn your first gem. What amazing fungi adaptations will you discover during your conversation with the Caterpillar?</p>

<hr>
    <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 3: The Mad Hatter's Tea Party</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Put on your swankiest hat and get ready to party with the Mad Hatter, Wonderland’s premiere supplier of fancy hats and herbal teas. Continue your quest by exploring the Mad Hatter’s selection of herbal teas and try to discover the magical, extraordinary way they can be used to soothe a sore throat, relieve a headache, and more. Then, play a round of Teacup Bean Bag Toss, Bowler Hat Bowling, or Flamingo Croquet to earn both your next gem and a special prize courtesy of the March Hare and the Dormouse.</p>

    <p class="text-left">Something is hiding in the trees of the Garden, and it looks like a large cat with a mischievous smile! Can you solve the riddles and find the clues to catch the Cheshire Cat and make it through the forest?</p>

<hr>
    <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 6: Bill the Lizard's Living Flower Patch</h4>
    <p class="text-left">You can learn an awful lot from the flowers because flowers in Wonderland talk! Stop in at Bill the Lizard’s Living Flower Patch to learn how flowers use different adaptations to attract pollinators. To earn your third gem, use what you’ve learned from Bill’s flowers to craft your own Wonderland pollinator. Then, take your pollinator on a hunt to find the six larger-than-life living flowers scattered throughout the Terrace Gardens. Can you find all six flowers?</p>

<hr>
    <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 7: Audience with the Queen</h4>
    <p class="text-left">Finish your quest at the palace of the Queen of Hearts. During your audience with the Queen, you’ll discover not only how her Wonderland roses change colors from white to red but also how some real-world roses, hydrangeas, and other plants can shapeshift and change colors, too. Earn your final gem by weaving a color-changing tassel to decorate a special bookmark crafted by the Queen of Hearts.</p>

<hr>
        <h4 class="text-left green">Chapter 8: Through the Looking Glass</h4>
        <p class="text-left">Attach the final gem to your key and use it to step through the Looking Glass and return to the real world.
