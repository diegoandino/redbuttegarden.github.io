	    <p class="text-center bold" style="padding: 10px;">Calling all witches and wizards! Join us for an enchanted evening at the fabled Oaklore Adademy of Magic, the premier school of witchcraft and wizardry. Explore the seemingly magical properties of real-lie plants from around the world as you select a magic wand, dig into herology, study magical creatures, and more! But be warned, the noxious witch Myrtle Spurge is at Oaklore creating mischief and mayhem. Can you complete your magical education and collect the magic spell ingredients you need to banish Myrtle Spurge from Oaklore? Find out this October at Garden After Dark!</p>
	    <p class="text-center bold" style="padding: 10px;">With crafts, activities, light displays, games, and more, this is a fun-filled evening you and your family won’t want to miss! Join us for Garden After Dark, an indoor/outdoor, costume and kid-friendly experience in the Garden to celebrate Halloween.</p>
			<p class="text-center bold" style="padding: 10px;">NEW! We have expanded Garden After Dark this year. The main entry to the event will be through the Red Butte Garden Amphitheatre gates, and not at the Visitor Center. Please park near the Amphitheatre.</p>
