						<p class="text-center">Before embarking on your adventure, pick up your family guide to Wonderland and your Curiosity Key outside the Visitor Center. You’ll need the Curiosity Key to unlock the Looking Glass, a magic portal you can use to leave Wonderland and return to the real world. But your key is missing its four magic gems! Rumor has it that four of Wonderland's most famous citizens have the missing gems. Visit each Wonderlandian, complete a simple task for him or her, and you'll be rewarded with a missing gem. Can you collect the missing gems, find the Looking Glass, and return home before the night is over?</p>
