  <p>This Utah native is a great perennial to have in any xeric garden with its large four-petaled flowers, bright pink buds, and delicate aroma.  It does best when grown in full sun with dry, infertile, well-drained soil and given plenty of room to spread.</p>
<p>  You can find this, or one of it's many beautiful subspecies growing in just about every county in Utah. Here at Red Butte, the best place to see it growing is along the north side of the path that follows the Great Wall or on the Children's Garden Sprout House roof. </p>
