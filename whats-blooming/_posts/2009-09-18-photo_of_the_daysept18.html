<div class = "text-center"><p>This long-lived subshrub grows into a rounded mound with green, thread-like, sticky green leaves.  It flowers from late summer into fall.  It prefers full sun and low water.</p>

<p>Like Rubber Rabbitbrush, Broom Snakeweed is also an indicator species of poor range management, often indicating overgrazing.</p>
