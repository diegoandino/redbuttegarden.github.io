<div class="text-center">Spring is back and she is putting on a beautiful display throughout the Garden! While we couldn't hazard a guess at how long this particular spring will last, it is well worth a visit while it's here.</div>

  <p>Blireana Plum  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Prunus x blireana</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This perfectly pink plum bursting with blooming buds invites you to explore the Herb Garden.</p>

  <p>Bloodroot&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Sanguinaria canadensis</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Tucked under the still-bare branches of the Sycamore, this diminutive darling has just begun to bloom in the Medicinal Garden.</p>

  <p>Texas Scarlet Flowering Quince &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>  Chaenomeles speciosa </i>&nbsp;'Texas Scarlet'</p>
  <p>This shrub is resplendent with bright red-orange blooms, and a few anomalous white ones which offers a fun example of the natural mutations that can occur in plants.</p>

  <p>Horsechestnut  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Aesculus hippocastanum</i>&nbsp;'Baumannii' </p>
  <p>As the weather warms, the resin that protects the buds from winter chill, bugs and fungi begins to melt away. Soon the resin will have dissipated enough for the bud to open revealing this year's flowers and leaves.</p>

  <p>Western Bluebell  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Mertensia brevistyla</i>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>A venture into the Natural Area is rewarded with the pink-purple-blue blooms of the this native, yellow-eyed flower.</p>

    <p>Leonard Messel Magnolia&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Magnolia x loebneri </i>&nbsp;'Leonard Messel' </p>
    <p>The striking flowers of our magnolias are dotting the Floral Walk. These short-lived flowers are reason enough to warrant a trip to the Garden this week!</p>

  <div class="text-center">
  <p>There is no guessing what this afternoon, let alone next week will bring as far as weather, but the parade of spring blooms has begun! Along with the reinvigoration of the plants comes a flurry of activity in the programs department. A great way to experience the Garden is through one of the many classes, exhibits or concerts available.</p>
