<p class="text-center"> Taxonomy fun fact: See how there are three petals on this flower, that is a sure sign that it is a monocot. Flowering plants are divided into two different groups, monocots and dicots. The term monocot means it has only one "seed leaf," termed cotyledon. The other group, dicot, has two "seed leafs." Another clue that this is a monocot is its parallel leaf veination.  Examples of other monocots are Orchids and Grasses. You can see this plant along the Floral Walk.</p>
