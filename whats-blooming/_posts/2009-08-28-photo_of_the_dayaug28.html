  <p>This large, native cousin to Bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) grows 3-12 feet high and sometimes becomes tree-like in the wild.</p>

<p>It's evergreen foliage and pale yellow flowers are pleasantly fragrant. Feathery seed heads cover the plant after flowering is through.
</p>
<p>Cliffrose is becoming more and more common in the plant trade every year. It makes a wonderfully unique addition to your waterwise garden.</p>

<p>Watch for this plant at next years Red Butte Garden's annual benefit plant sale in the native and waterwise plant section</p>
