<div class="text-center">The Garden is in its full glory, absolutely awash with blooms and beauty! Every week is bringing a chance to experience something new in the garden, some of which are only available for a limited time. Be sure to visit the Garden often to take advantage of every window of opportunity!</div>

  <p>Dragon Arum&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dracunculus vulgaris</i>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The striking flower and interesting foliage of this plant will draw you in, but...</p>

  <p>Dragon Arum &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Dracunculus vulgaris</i>&nbsp;'Roseus'</p>
  <p>Once you're close you'll be sharing company with the flies and insects that are drawn in by the equally striking foul smell that this arum produces to attract pollinators! The memory of the striking scent and beauty of this flower will last far longer than the actual bloom, which won't last long.</p>

  <p>Sego Lily&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Calochortus nuttallii</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our beautiful state flower is blooming in the Natural Area and offers all of the beauty and non of the malodorous side effects. This one is a little more elusive, but can be found towards the back of the natural area on the way to the Quarry House. They will be gone soon, so don't delay!</p>

  <p>Cicada</p>
  <p>While you're in the Natural Area you'll be serenaded by the calls of these short-lived, but long winded insects.</p>

    <p>Bailey's Hedgehog Cactus &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Echinocereus reichenbachii ssp. baileyi</i>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Sprout House Roof is truly glorious right now, with a rainbow of colors including quite a few cacti. Be sure to stop by and enjoy these shimmering beauties soon.</p>

      <p>Tulip Tree  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Liriodendron tulipifera</i>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Down in the Water Pavilion the tulip tree is currently coated in the seemingly out of place tulip-like blooms. If you joined us on Arbor Day and took home a tree sapling, this is what you have to look forward to!</p>

    <p>Mallard Mama and Babes</p>
    <p>The lower pond is home to some adorable baby mallards and a couple of very proud mothers. These cuties would love to see you, especially if you have some of the feed available on the deck!</p>
