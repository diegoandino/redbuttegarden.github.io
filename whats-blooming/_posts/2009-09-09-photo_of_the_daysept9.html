<p>  Devil's Claw is native to the southwest region of the United states, and can be found growing in Utah's southern most counties.</p>
  <p>This annual plant grows to about 2 or 3 feet tall and does best when it is planted in hot, humid weather with warm summer nights.  It is very drought tolerant and sun loving.</p>
  <p>Native Americans ate the seeds and would make a black dye from the pods.  The fibers from the pods were also used in basket-weaving.</p>
