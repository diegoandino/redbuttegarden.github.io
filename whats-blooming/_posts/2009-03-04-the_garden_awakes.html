  Spring appears to be right around the corner!  Throughout the garden
various bulbs are starting to push their leaves through the soil; some
have started blooming. Things are beginning to green up and even a few
autum crocuses couldn't wait for fall and decided to bloom now.

    <p><i>Jasminum nudiflorum</i>  Winter Jasmine</p>
    <p>This is our earliest blooming shrub at Red Butte, with its first flower usually opening around the end of February. Look for it in the Medicinal Garden under the Pussywillow tree.</p>

    <p><i>Chimonanthus praecox </i> Wintersweeet</p>
    <p>A recently rediscovered shrub here, the flowers of the Wintersweet have a spicy sweet fragrance. You'll find this shrub in the Fragrance garden along the west perimeter.</p>

    It is almost time for our daffodils to start blooming, so check back often, or better yet, come visit the garden.
