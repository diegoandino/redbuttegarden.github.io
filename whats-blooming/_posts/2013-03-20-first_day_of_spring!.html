  <p>Color is beginning to show in all places of the Garden, from the top of the Four Seasons Garden all the way down to the Rose Garden and everywhere in between.</p>

  <p>As usual, Rijnveld's Early Sensation Daffodil was the first daffodil to begin blooming in the Four Seasons Garden. Little patches of yellow speckle the flower beds now, but soon, everywhere you look will be a sea of yellow.</p>
