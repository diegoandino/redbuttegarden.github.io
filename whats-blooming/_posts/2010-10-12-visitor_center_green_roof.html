  <p>The planting medium used is called LitetopÂ® Soil.  It is a specially blended lightweight growing medium composed of organic and mineral material. It retains moisture for plantings, yet drains excess water quickly and doesn't compact.</p>
  <p>For those interested in the plant varieties used the list includes: <i>Sedum rupestre</i> 'Angelina' (lime green patches), <i>Sedum hispanicum</i> 'Purple Form' (gray-green patches adjacent to lime green patches), <i>Sedum spurium</i> 'Voodoo' (reddish patches), <i>Sedum kamtaschaticum</i> (dark green patches in three of the corners), and <i>Sempervivum</i> 'Commander Hay' (patch of plants in the very center of the roof)</p>
