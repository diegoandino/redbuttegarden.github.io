<div class="text-center">As in every garden, we here at Red Butte are constantly fighting the war of the plants we want and the plants we don't want (weeds). This week we are spotlighting a few of the weeds we often pull, along with a few fun factoids that will hopefully add a little trivia-type joy to the woe of weed pulling in your garden.</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

  <img src="/images/blogs/Solanum dulcamara Flower Leaf SS13.jpg" width="550" height="751" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Bittersweet Nightshade&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Solanum dulcamara</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This European native has been introduced to most continents and grows from sea level to over 1.25 miles above sea level in the Alps.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>



<div class="text-center">
  <img src="/images/blogs/Solanum dulcamara Fruit SS13.jpg" width="550" height="652" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Bittersweet Nightshade Fruit &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Solanum dulcamara</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>While the fruit of this plant is poisonous, the plant itself was used to treat eczema, rheumatism and whooping cough in Europe for hundreds of years.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>


<div class="text-center">

  <img src="/images/blogs/Amaranthus retroflexus Flower Habit SS13.jpg" width="550" height="696" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Redroot Pigweed  &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This native annual was used by Iroquois witchcraft practitioners to make a person break out in cancer, and by the Navajo people as an antidote to snakebites.</p>
</div>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Elaeagnus angustifolia Seedling Habit SS13.jpg" width="550" height="751" alt="" title="" />
    <p>Russian Olive&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Elaeagnus angustifolia</i>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This native to Europe and Central Asia is considered an invasive, noxious weed through much of the United States due to it aggressively displacing native cottonwoods and willows along waterways.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Epilobium ciliatum Plant SS13.jpg" width="550" height="810" alt="" title="" />
    <p>American Willowherb &nbsp; &nbsp;<i> Epilobium ciliatum</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>This perennial native has become a favorite food source for the invasive Australian Grapevine Moth's larvae here in North America, and has become invasive in China and Europe after being introduced in those countries.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Portulaca oleracea Habit SS13.jpg" width="550" height="332" alt="" title="" />
    <p>Common Purslane &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Portulaca oleracea</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>While this invasive annual is mostly considered a lawn weed in the U.S., it is grown extensively as a vegetable that is eaten fresh or in soups throughout Europe, Asia and Mexico.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Solanum physalifolium Flower SS13.jpg" width="550" height="372" alt="" title="" />
    <p>Hoe Nightshade&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Solanum physalifolium</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>This invasive annual is known to carry a bacterium that causes brown rot, which can spread when rivers along which the plant are growing are tapped to irrigate potato fields.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-center">As you are toiling or basking in maintaining your garden this summer, we hope you take break to enjoy the many Gardens here at Red Butte. Whether as a pleasant respite or a source of inspiration, this is a great time to visit the Garden.
