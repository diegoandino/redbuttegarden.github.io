  <p>The importance of pollinators, and their decline, has become a more common topic in the news and people's minds. The Garden has a great many ideas for plants that attract pollinators, especially the beautiful Butterfly walk in the Children's Garden. Take some time to bask in the show of pollinators throughout the Garden today!</p>
