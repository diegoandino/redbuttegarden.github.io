  <p>Pinyon pine is a widely distributed tree that grows throughout the Intermountain region of North America.  It is sometimes called the Colorado Pinyon.</p>

  <p>In the wild it grows very slowly, and trees with a trunk diameter of 6 to 8 inches can be over a hundred years old. Pinyon's typically grow in either pure stands or mixed with Utah juniper.</p>

  <p>Pinus edulis is one of 20 species of pine tree that delicious pine nuts are harvested from, and now is the time of year that they are collected.  The seeds are extremely important to wildlife.  They are eaten by many mammals and birds.</p>

  <p>Many nurseries are now beginning to carry this tree for home gardens.  Pinyon pines are very water-wise and make a great addition to every xeric planting.</p>
