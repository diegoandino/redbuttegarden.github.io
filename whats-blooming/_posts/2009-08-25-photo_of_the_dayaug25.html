  <p>The Sacred Datura is a member of the nightshade family (which also includes tobacco, and food crops such as potatoes, tomatoes and chile peppers). Datura is a perennial herb which grows from a tuberous root to 2-5 feet in height and 3-6 feet in width.  It has dark green leaves which grows to 6 inches long and are oval or heart shaped.</p>

<p>Datura is commonly found in washes and roadsides at elevations from 1000 to 6000 feet and begins flowering in mid to late summer.
</p>
<p>The flower is large.....the largest native flower to Utah (5-6 inches in diameter and 6-8 inches in length). They open around dusk and stay open throughout the next day. The flowers are followed by a 2 inch round prickly seed pod.
</p>
<p>The Sacred Datura contains numerous toxic alkaloids.  All parts of this plant are very poisonous if ingested.
</p>
<p>Native Americans used this plant for ceremonial purposes to induce visions, many of them dying in the process.
