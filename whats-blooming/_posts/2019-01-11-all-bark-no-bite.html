<p class="text-center">Usually overshadowed by bright flowers and green leaves, the bark of trees and shrubs can actually be quite interesting. The color can range from white, to yellow, to reds and browns with textures that are completely smooth to others that are deeply furled or corky. Winter is by far the best time to observe the fascinating world of bark. Woof Woof.</p>
