<p>  This compact cultivar produces dark purple-blue flowers that open the earliest out of all the Bluebeard cultivars. The flowers open late in the year on new growth.</p>
<p>Bluebeards do best when planted in average to rich, well drained soils in full sun to light shade.  Treat this shrub as an herbaceous perennial and cut it back in late winter or early spring.  Hardy to USDA Zone 5 and often self sow and are easy to root from softwood cuttings.</p>
<p>Plant this superb shrub in your garden to attract butterflies and other pollinators.</p>
