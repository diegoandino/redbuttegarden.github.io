Enjoying winter in the garden takes a keener eye, and a thicker coat, but the rewards are there for the observant and intrepid visitor. Take the time to enjoy a stroll through the Garden and above the inversion this week and enjoy some of our wonderful winter buds. A great way to explore the garden would be with a tour of our wonderful, and warm, greenhouse on February 6th, or a garden tour highlighting our enchanting evergreens on February 22nd.
