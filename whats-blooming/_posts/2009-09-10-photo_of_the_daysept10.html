<p>  The fragrant, graceful greenery of this herb can be used as a garnish or snipped like dill and used for a last minute flavor enhancer.  The flavor of fennel is sweeter and more delicate than anis and, when cooked becomes even lighter and more elusive than in its raw state.
</p>
<p>  The seeds can be found in grocery stores both whole and ground and are used in both sweet and savory foods, as well as to flavor many liquers.  Fennel is rich in vitamin A and contains a fair amount of calcium, phosphorus and potassium.</p>
