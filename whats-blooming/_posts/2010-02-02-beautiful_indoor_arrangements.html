  <p>Just because it's winter doesn't mean there isn't plenty of color for you to come see at the gardens.</p>

  <p>  We begin our tour with some outstanding specimens in the Visitor Center. At the top of the stairs your eyes should immediately be drawn to our tallest plant, our Screw Pine.</p>
  <p>Common Screw Pine   <i>Pandanus utilis</i></p>

  <p>We recieved this beautiful plant as part of our prehistoric display in 2006 and it has become a permanent part of our Vistor Center indoor display.</p>

  <p>Whenever it's needed Scott and his group of helpers rearrange and change the various displays around this magnificent eye catcher.  This month we have a very special addition to this display. A very generous donor, visitor and friend of the garden, Hugh Bollinger has provided a rare species of kangaroo paw that is just about to flower. It is located in the pot of the <i>Pandanus utilis</i>.</p>

  <p>Red and Green Kangaroo Paw is the most admired of all the Kangaroo Paw species and is endemic to Western Australia where it is their official floral emblem. (state flower).</p>

  <p>Just to the right of the <i>Pandanus utilis </i>is another beautiful flowering tree that you can often find potted outside in the formal gardens during the summer.</p>

  <p>Scarlet Bottlebrush  <i>Callistemon citrinus</i></p>

  <p>Proceeding into the Orangerie, keepy your eyes alert for the always changing potted plant displays.  This month there is a beutiful arrangement put together by Scott using pink, white and rec carnations to help set the mood for the upcoming St. Valentine's Day Holiday.</p>

  <p>After you have found this gorgeous flower I'm sure your sniffer has already picked up on the sweet smell of the orange tree in full bloom.  Admire the blossoms now and check back often to watch as they grow into beautiful baseball sized oranges.</p>
