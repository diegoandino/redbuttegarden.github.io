  <p>This year, the most common question I have received is how to tell apart our globe thistles. Hopefully this blooming blog post will clear things up and make you an expert the next time you visit.</p>

  <p>In case you do not know what I'm talking about, I'll fill you in.  Near our Rainbird sculpture on the the Floral Walk and entrance to the Fragrance Garden are 3 different colors of Echinops; two on the east side and one on the west side of the path.</p>

  <p>First, on the east side of the path, we have just the straight species Echinops ritro. It has a light blue, spiky inflorescence.</p>

  <p>Next, on the west side of the path, we have <i>Echinops</i> 'Arctic Glow'. It looks very similar to the straight species but it is about 1/2 to 2/3 its height and its inflorescence is a very pale blue to white.</p>

  <p>Finally, on the east side of the path again, we have <i>Echinops bannaticus</i> 'Blue Glow'. This one is about the same height as the straight species, maybe slightly taller with very deep blue to purple flowers.</p>

Globe thistles make great cut or dried flowers. They add great interest to any garden and are magnets for many species of bees.
