  <p>This popular bluish-green, mounding shrub bears large flowers with
striking, bushy center stamens.  The reddish-brown fruit capsuels ripen
around September and persist well into the winter.</p>

<p>The foliage is semi-evergreen to evergreen depending
upon which zone it is planted in. It is often planted as a hedge, a
shrub border or in masses.</p>
