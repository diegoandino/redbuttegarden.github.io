  After many hours of research and a few edits, its ready....and it's perfect!! Red Butte finally has its own Pocket Naturalist to accompany you through the garden. It's conveniently sized to fit in your back pocket and packed with information about the various plants in the garden. There is even a map on the back so you don't get lost. They are available for purchase at the Visitor Center Gift Shop.
