  <p>The garden is still alive with blossoms. There isn't anywhere in the garden you won't find beautiful, interesting and fragrant blossoms.

  <p>Bear's Breeches <i> Acanthus spinosus</i></p>
  <p>You can see Bear's Breeches growing in the Rose Garden on the pathway around the wedding lawn.</p>

  <p>Bottlebrush Buckeye  <i>Aesculus parviflora</i></p>
  <p>This gorgeous shrub can be found hidden along the Fern Gully trail on the Floral Walk. </p>

  <img src="/images/blogs/old-posts/Rosa 'ANDeli'.jpg" width="450" height="402" alt="" title="" />
  <p> Double Delight Rose  <i>Rosa</i> 'ANDeli'</p>
  <p>This is one of the most fragrant roses I have found in the garden.  Exposure to UV light stimulates the petals to turn red.  Look for this unique rose along the south path in the Rose Garden.  </p>
