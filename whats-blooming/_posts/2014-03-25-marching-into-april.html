<div class="text-center">It definitely looks like spring is here. Early-flowering shrubs are blooming one by one, bulbs are popping up in every corner bringing much anticipated color, and the Natural Area is providing its own show of native flowers.</div>
<br>
<br>

  <p>Cousin to the Liverwort in the Medicinal Garden, you can find this little guy in the bed across from the Papa Moose sculpture.</p>

<div class="text-center">

  <p>Winter Jasmine&nbsp; &nbsp;<i> Jasminum nudiflorum</i>&nbsp; </p>

<div class="text-center">

    <p>Long-stalk Spring Parsley&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Cymopteris longipes</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the first to bloom in the Natural Area, the leaves of this native were once boiled and used for food by the Goshute and Ute tribes.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>


<div class="text-center">
  <p>Here are a couple things to look for in the next few days when you come visit the Garden.</p>
</div>

    <p>Twinleaf&nbsp; &nbsp;<i> Jeffersonia diphylla</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although it wasn't blooming at the time of writing, its flowers will most likely be open before the end of the week. Be sure to keep an eye on it. You can find it growing beneath the London Plane Tree in the Medicinal Garden.</p>

    <p>If you've been putting off your visit because you wanted to see our impressive display of over 224,000 Daffodils, then now is the time to come. Daffodils all over the garden are opening and filling the space with all shades of yellow.</p>
