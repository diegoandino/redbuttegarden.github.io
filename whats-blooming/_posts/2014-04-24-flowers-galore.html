<div class="text-center">There are so many plants blooming in the Garden that it is hard to choose which ones to highlight in this week's blog.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class="text-center">Starting near the Visitor Center and Orangerie we have our first show stopper.</div>
<br>
<div class="text-center">

  <p>Koreanspice Viburnum &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Viburnum carlesii</i></p>
  <p>The flowers are admired for their robust springtime fragrance.</p>
</div>

<div class="text-center">

  <img src="/images/blogs/Narcissus 'Geranium' Flowers Front JWB14.jpg" width="550" height="699" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Geranium Daffodil &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Narcissus </i>&nbsp; 'Geranium'</p>
  <p>This fragrant beauty grows just across the path from the Oak Sculpture.</p>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="/images/blogs/Erythronium x 'Pagoda' Flowers JWB14.jpg" width="550" height="830" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Pagoda Glacier Lily &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Erythronium x</i>&nbsp;'Pagoda'</p>
  <p>Right now, a stunning display of these lilies can be found along the Oak Tunnel at the entrance to the Natural Area.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>


<div class="text-center">

  <img src="/images/blogs/Syringa vulgaris 'Firmament' Inflorescence Flowers JWB14.jpg" width="550" height="720" alt="" title="" />
  <p>Firmament Lilac &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Syringa vulgaris</i>&nbsp;'Firmament'</p>
  <p>If Lilacs are what you're waiting for, your wait is over! They began opening this week.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="text-center"> Natives you say? We've got those too.</div>

<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Amelanchier alnifolia Flowers Petals JWB14.jpg" width="550" height="638" alt="" title="" />
    <p>Serviceberry&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i> &nbsp;</p>
    <p>The juicy berries on this native shrub are quickly gobbled up by birds of all types.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

      <img src="/images/blogs/Pachystima myrsinites Flowers and Leaves JWB14 .JPG" width="550" height="615" alt="" title="" />
      <p>Mountain Lover  &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Pachystima myrsinites</i> &nbsp;</p>
      <p>The tiny flowers are easy to overlook on this native evergreen. Look close and you won't be disappointed.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<div class="text-center">

    <img src="/images/blogs/Tree Squirrel 3 JWB14.jpg" width="550" height="707" alt="" title="" />
    <p></p>
    <p>During your visit, don't forget to keep an eye out for some of our resident animals. Here we have a tree squirrel in the Courtyard munching on a seed.</p>
</div>

<br>

<div class="text-center">
  <p>Just a reminder, Arbor Day, Friday, April 25, is NO longer a Garden Free Day. We will still have lots of school groups coming through on that day, but, for a less crowded experience in a magical season, we now offer a new free day in the fall, on the first Monday in October, honoring our founder, Zeke Dumke.</p>
