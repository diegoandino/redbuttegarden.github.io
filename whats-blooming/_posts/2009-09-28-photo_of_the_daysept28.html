<div class = "text-center"><p>Bright, lemon-yellow, crepe paper-like blooms cover the mounding silver-green foliage from mid summer into fall.</p>

<p>The garders who introduced this plant into cultivation gave it the cultivar name 'Shimmer' after their favorite song by the band Fuel.</p>

<p>All parts of this plant are poisonous if injested.</p>
