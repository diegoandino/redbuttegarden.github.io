    <p>Hummingbird Mint <i>Agastache rupestris</i></p>
    <p>The best place to see this plant and the hummingbirds it attracts is at the bottom of the Four Seasons Garden on the north side.</p>

    <p>Another great place to see hummingbirds is in the Fragrance Garden by the fountain. The Mimosa Tree's red flowers are very alluring to the little birds. </p>
