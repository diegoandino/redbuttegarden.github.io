<p>  Chamomile is a low-growing plant with finely divided leaves.  The daisy-like inflorescence has yellow disk flowers in the center and silvery-white ray flowers surrounding them.</p>

<p>When crushed, the plant gives off a scent similar to apples or bubblegum.
</p>
<p>Historically this plant has been used to relieve pain, including stomach pain, toothache and sore eyes.  More commonly it is used as a mild sedative often in the form of tea.</p>

<p>It is sometimes known as Roman Chamomile or English Chamomile and was introduced to North America by early British settlers. </p>
