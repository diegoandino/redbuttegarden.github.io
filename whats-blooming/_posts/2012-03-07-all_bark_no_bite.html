  <p>It looks like, for the moment, Utah might be having a little bit of winter. So while everything that's blooming is under a thin blanket of snow, lets take our attention to the often overlooked and attractive bark possessed by so many trees and shrubs within the gardens.</p>

  <p>The Paperbark Maple can be found along the Floral Walk and in the Perennial Garden. The exfoliating bark looks nice when back lit with morning sun.</p>

  <p>Sweetgum &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Liquidambar styraciflua</i></p>
  <p>The Sweetgum trees have interesting corky bark appendages that often only grow along one side of younger branches. Red Butte's Sweetgum trees are planted as a beautiful backdrop to our Amphitheatre stage.

  <p>Paperbark Birch &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Betula papyrifera</i></p>
  <p>The Paperbark Birch is a real eye catcher during all seasons. Ours can be found growing near the creek bed near the bridge that connects the Rose Garden to the Amphitheatre stage.</p>

    <p>Lacebark Elm&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Ulmus parvifolia</i>&nbsp; 'Allee'</p>
    <p>The Lacebark Elm might be one of the first trees you encounter when you visit the Garden. These trees with exfoliating bark that curls are planted as shade trees in the courtyard just outside</p>

  <p>Other trees with great bark to look out for are Lacebark Pine <i>(Pinus bungeana)</i> in the Four Seasons Garden, Columnar Scotch Pine <i>(Pinus sylvestris 'Fastigiata')</i> next to the Water Pavillion and Seven Son Flower <i>(Heptacodium miconioides)</i> in the Fragrance Garden.

</p>
  <p>Now is a great time to walk the gardens and discover winter-interesting trees and shrubs that you would like to add to your garden this upcoming season.</p>
