  <p>This Butterfly Bush cultivar displays bright pink sprays of flowers,
  often reaching 18 inches long atop beautiful silvery foliage.</p>
  <p>The flowers attract butterflies and hummingbirds that feed on the nectar that is present from late summer into fall.</p>
  <p>It is recommended that this plant be pruned back in late winter to
  encourage new shoots to grow from the bottom of the plant, as these
  branches tend to be stronger and produce larger, more beautiful flower
  heads.</p>
