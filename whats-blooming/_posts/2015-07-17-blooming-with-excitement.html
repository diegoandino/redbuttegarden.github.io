  <p>Flower-of-an-hour &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Hibiscus trionum</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although beautiful, this large-flowered annual is a non-native garden weed that is found in almost every state. Its common name was given because of a very short flower life.</p>

  <p>Lesser Goldfinch &nbsp;&nbsp;<i> Spinus psaltria</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This pair of birds was seen drinking from our wayside fountain. This is a great place to get out of the sun and take a break, but we don't recommend you drink out of the fountain.</p>
  <br>

  <p>The Garden changes with every passing day, it's a different experience each time you visit.</p>
