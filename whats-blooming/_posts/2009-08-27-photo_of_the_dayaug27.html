  <p>This cactus is protected under the Endangered Species Act and is listed as federally threatened.  It is endemic to Utah and grows in the harsh dry climate of the Uintah Basin.  Red Butte Garden and the BLM salvaged the cacti in our collection in 2002 from  a site prior to their loss due to habitat destruction resulting from oil extration.</p>
