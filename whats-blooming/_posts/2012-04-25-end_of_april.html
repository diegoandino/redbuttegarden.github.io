  <p>Spruce Picea sp. &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Erigeron divergens</i>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although you may not even notice them, the conifers are also beginning to bloom. Most of their flowers are inconspicuous, but this particular spruce in a pot near the Courtyard fountain displays bright red female cones. The male cone (to the left of the female cone) is releasing its pollen and some pollen grains can be seen stuck on the scales of the female cone in the photo below.</p>
