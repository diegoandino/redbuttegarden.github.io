  <p>If you've visited Red Butte this month you have probably noticed that spring is trying to push winter away......</p>

  <p>  We have a new addition to our early spring bloomers this year at Red Butte. Located under the Russian Olive trees in the Mediterrainean area of the Floral Walk there are Hardy Cyclamens blooming their little hearts out.</p>

  <p>Something I found interesting as I walked through the garden was the color the leaves turned on the Scabland Penstemon.  During the active growing period of this native perennial, it's leaves are a bright lime green color but in the winter they turn shades of maroon and burgundy.</p>

  <p>Finally, I thought I'd post a photo of the Dutchman's Pipe growing in the Orangerie.  It's giant flowers are larger than a dinner plate and when first open, have a very strong lemon scent.</p>
