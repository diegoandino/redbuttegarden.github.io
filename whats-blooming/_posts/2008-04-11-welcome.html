<div class = "text-center">
  <p>Thank you for visiting our "What's Blooming Blog".</p>

<p>It's a great place to see wonderful images of cool and interesting plants in bloom here at The Garden.</p>

<p>My name is Jason Baker and I am the Curator of Plant Records for Red Butte Garden. If you find me out wandering in the garden, come over and say "Hi". I'll be the 6' 4" tall guy with the camera around my neck.</p>
