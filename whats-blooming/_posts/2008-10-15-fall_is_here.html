    <p>It seems like just yesterday that we couldn't wait for the snow to melt so we could get out and work in our gardens, and already some of us have  had to break out the snowshovels.  The summer just flew by.</p>

<div class = "text-center">
  <p>Now is the time to visit the garden to witness the transition to fall.  There are trees changing colors in just about every location here at Red Butte.</p>

While you're here, don't forget to see all the native trees changing colors along the trails in our Natural Area. There are also many plants still blooming and our grasses are at their peak right now. So what are you waiting for? Come visit Red Butte Garden.  You know you want to.
