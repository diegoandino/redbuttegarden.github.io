  <p> Before you leave the Visitor Center and enter the formal gardens, check out the new addition in the north east corner.  This cycad has been a part of Red Butte Garden for the last 40 years. It was formally planted in our conservation greenhouse and it likes its new home so much it is putting out a new set of leaves!
