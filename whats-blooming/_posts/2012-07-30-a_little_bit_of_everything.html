  <p>It is the end of July and there are still plenty of flowers to see. Some plants are still flowering, some are re-flowering and other flowers are new.</p>
  <p>The great thing about re-visiting Red Butte Garden is the constant change of color and variety of blossoms. Each time you visit is like your first time.</p>
