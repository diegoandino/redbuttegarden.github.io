  <p>The drooping seed heads hang in clusters from slightly arching stems atop an upright clump of bamboo-like foliage. Its green leaves turn
copper in fall and the seed heads emerge green but turn purplish bronze
by late summer then dry to a straw color.</p>

<p>Clumping grasses like this
provide nest sites and winter cover for quail and sparrows. They also
provide fall and winter seeds for a number of birds including
cardinals, towhees, juncos, sparrows and finches.
