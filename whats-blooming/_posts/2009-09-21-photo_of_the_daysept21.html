<div class = "text-center"><p>In most parts of the country, this penstemon is usually grown as an annual, but is hardy in zones 8-10.  If it is grown with dry cover and dry soil, in a protected location, it can survive much colder winters.</p>

<p>The species is native from the colder parts of the Mexico mountains.
